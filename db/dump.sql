\N	\N	As planned, the most notable risk is the timelines extending beyond the TIC funding period.  If the study stays on track, the last subject will complete approximately 6 months before the end of TIC funding, and publication/Clinical Study Report (CSR) will be completed in Jun 2023 consistent with the last month of TIC funding.  If the protocol is successfully redesigned to a bayesian design (planned for comprehensive consultation), this could favorably impact the required number of participants, reduce the period for enrollment, and increase the odds of completing the trial within the scope of the current TIC funding period.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	51	This proposal has been pushed through for NCATS review.

The Utah TIC recommends keeping the study to U.S. sites only as it is time consuming to get Health Canada (FDA-equivalent) approval. This will delay start-up for this site because approval in Canada may not start until FDA approval is received.    The Utah TIC recommends that Dr. Mack starts working on putting the IND package together once the grant is submitted and possibly request a pre-IND meeting with the FDA.	\N	Study timeline is not feasible. It would be very difficult to complete the entire RCT from start to finish in a 3 year period.	The Utah TIC advised the PI that the funding mechanism for this scope of study will not be adequate to produce a successful trial. The PI has $400K over 3 years for DCC services but Utah TIC estimates that $900K over 3 years will be needed.	\N	\N	\N	\N	208	\N	\N	\N

\N	\N	As long as the study teams can retain the subjects that are enrolled in the study, the timelines that are presented seem feasible.  If subjects are not staying in the study to the end and replacement subjects are needed, then the timelines could extend.	A full review of the budget has been done by the TIC including 2 additional sites (4 sites total).  The submitting PI is willing to work with the TIC securing the additional funds.  Initially the CTSA pilot funding, however it has been clarified that there is no CTSA pilot funding being used for this study.	Straight forward study design.  During the consultation it was refined by the PIs to what is presented in the summary.  This study was peer reviewed and scored by the NIH, according to the submitting PI, the only substantial critique was that the study was too invasive with liver MRI and ultrasound and repeated intravenous glucose tolerance testing - - all of which have been removed in the current protocol.	\N	\N	\N	46	\N	Retention of participants for up to 1 year while having them commit to 1-3 phlebotomy sessions that can take 1-2 hours each may be difficult and current compensation noted in the submitting PIs budget is low.	\N

Items to Consider Addressing in Grant Application:  -UC-Davis Site: Because the aim of this trial is to obtain more generalizable study results across a larger number of sites, the inclusion of UC-Davis as a participating site was  questioned. Because UC-Davis already has data on the population enrolled from the previous pilot trial, it may be better not to include them as a site in this trial. On the other hand, from the PI perspective, it is difficult to stay in tune with the day-to-day management and detail of a study when not involved as a participating site. It was recommended that this potential question be addressed in the grant application.  -Consider including only one primary outcome (the first outcome listed) and moving the second primary outcome to the list of secondary outcomes. This may be a better strategy moving forward and  may be better received at study section.	\N	\N	-The study is not feasible based on the budget and is largely underfunded unless the Investigators are allowed to go over the cap for the grant submission.	Additional funding to add 2 more participating sites could allow the study to be powered at 90% (vs. 80%), which may be especially helpful for the 0-3 year old subgroup; however, this would also lead to the need for additional funding to support added sites.	\N	\N	\N	207	\N	\N	\N

No major concerns with the proposal timeline were raised during the consultation by the TIC team.	No concerns noted with funding IC or mechanism in relation to the proposed study.  The lack of budget information raises some concern about consideration of budget in design feasibility.  However, they have indicated the desire for assistance from the TIC in developing the study budget.  No additional concerns raised.	Sample size calculation may need some continued adjustment given considerations raised about including clinical meaning in the effect size estimate.

E2E-  The study PI's main question for the JHU/Tufts TIC was "are there implementation measures that would shrink the efficacy to effectiveness gap?" The study team is looking at traditional fidelity measures such as intervention reach and adoption; what else should they consider if they establish efficacy to show they aren't too far from effectiveness given this is a real world intervention?  Dr. Harry Selker, Principal Investigator of the Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA), provided some context and advice to Dr. Wieland. After reviewing the proposal, Dr. Selker concluded this study is more of an EE2 trial, since it includes participants based on effectiveness criteria and looks at an efficacy outcome. This is rare and superior to an E2E trial.  Additionally, the Dr. Wieland's question "are there implementation measures that would shrink the efficacy to effectiveness gap?" is now moot after this analysis. Suggestions for next steps would be for Dr. Wieland to disseminate this study more broadly across the country and go through PCORI for a dissemination project.      Another suggestion was to find a parallel population to obtain baseline event rates and baseline effectiveness on standard of care compared to the intervention group.  Suggestion to obtain info from public data sources or public health assessments.     Best Practices for Multi-site Clinical Trial-  This is the PI's first multi-center trial and he was interested in some advice on best practices for running a multi-center trial. Specifically he had questions regarding best practices for communication, data handling, regulatory environment, etc.  Communication-  •\tCreate a managerial structure that allows the PI to know what is happening at the other sites; This person should not be the study PI but report directly to the PI (i.e. a Project Manager).  o\tEnsure that a Mayo Project Manager provides oversight to the other two enrolling sites.  o\tThe Mayo PM can help problem solve and mitigate issues and help to ensure high quality data from the other sites.   •\tFrequent assessment of the intervention fidelity is important. If the intervention is not being rendered appropriately, there needs to be an improvement process in place.  o\tThe two most common reasons for an effect size not being reproduced is the population is different than the pilot or the intervention isn't being rendered as closely as it was done in the test population.    Data Handling-  Regularly review the data collected and ensure it is being collected properly; prioritize the key pieces of data and ensure important data is not missing.  •\tMonitor screening and enrollment on a weekly basis   Risk Assessment  •\tConsider an outside third party assessment of the study risks to identify places where the study could go wrong.   •\tConsider reaching out locally at Mayo Clinic for assistance with this. Find a set of colleagues who have already completed this type of study and could assess global risk to your trial (i.e. technology risks - not everyone who has a cell phone and can't receive texts.)    Site Monitoring-  •\tSmall portion of budget already allotted to ensuring the intervention fidelity (sit-ins at the clinics)  o\tDetermine who will be doing this assessment and who will be assessed (RCs, PI).   o\tConsider an independent monitor.   •\tDetermine key performance indicators that you could monitor during the study	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	385	\N	\N	\N

DCC planning and execution:  There were some discussions around what the Trial Innovation Network could provide as a DCC/CCC. This would involve additional funding from Dr. Khosla, and also involve the idea of incorporating an operational hypothesis and innovations into the execution of the multi-center trial.   Ultimately, however, Dr. Khosla decided that Mayo and UCSF were better suited to be the DCC/CCC as they have collaborated previously and have expertise in the area of osteoporosis trials. The UCSF Co-PI oversees a fairly large clinical coordinating effort specifically related to NIH and industry studies related to osteoporosis.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	382	\N	\N	\N

During the meetings, there were additional discussions around adaptive statistics and consortium task allocation as described below.  ADAPTIVE STATISTICS: Statistical experts from the Hopkins TIC offered Dr. Ratan and team advice in the area of adaptive statistics. There will be a need to pre-define the variables that will be used to move a patient from one therapy to another or a combined therapy to another (Need to know when one pathway will be rejected and a new one will be initiated). Adapt the trials around the biomarkers that are mostly kinematic measures but eventually come to image-based measures or biochemical measures. Develop a platform where data can be clustered across multiple interventions which would be the first platform of its kind in neurological disease space. Discussion around the need to include not only impairment outcome biomarkers but also include quality of life outcomes as they can be practical, personal and financial measures of therapy success.  Although secondary endpoints, quality of life outcomes are important for scalability and applicability, and will be an expectation during peer review for funding and editorial review prior to publication.  Suggestion to conduct focus groups to determine the important outcomes for the patients. There was also a discussion around the fact the Hopkins TIC has experience in building mathematical models to adaptive design that improve effect size and reduce sample numbers.   CONSORTIUM: The discussion centered around the idea of task allocation as this network develops between a Core Lab, a Data Coordinating Center and a Clinical Coordinating Center. Other topics discussed were: the PI should always have the ability to have access to the study data, and  meta data around trial execution and  the addition of operational hypothesis and innovation will be requirements if this study moves forward with the Trial Innovation Network.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	343	\N	\N	\N

\N	\N	Timeline seems unnecessarily aggressive with respect to enrollment.  Our project team suggested increasing the enrollment period by at least 1 yr. to accommodate the power calculations.	Project carries a significant burden for sites and budget is a significant concern.  It will almost certainly require more than $500K per year and thus be subject to additional requirements from NHLBI to submit an application.	TIC team only identified one concern with design in the initial consultation. Our TIC statistical lead expressed concern with the derivation of the historical control rate and its variability. After additional background information was supplied, we suggested a re-assessment of power calculations to connect the design to the historical literature.

Overall timeline is a relatively short total duration of 30 months from enrollment start to analysis completion, thus causing no concern for services through the TIN.  Funding timeline is behind, but the Arthritis Association has been involved in planning dates.	Project has been awarded for $950K directs by the Arthritis Foundation. Study appears to be underfunded where coordinating center (CC) activities are concerned. $100K CC budget allotted for a phase 1, multi-site, IND trial, with a duration of 30 mo. will likely need to be supplemented by additional external funding or changes to other areas of the study budget.  Additional external funding mechanism yet to be identified. Coordinating center bids from 3 centers expected by Feb 2018.	No concerns about study design were raised by the initial consultation team, however no protocol was available for review.

\N	\N	Timeline appears feasible but re-evaluation will be necessary once the cohort discovery is completed. The ability of the targeted U.S. sites to enroll a diverse population could have a significant impact on the projected timeline in relation to accomplishing goals related to generalizability.	Budget is projected to exceed $500,000 in direct costs per year. There is no current plan for engaging additional funding sources. The budget will be fully explored as part of the comprehensive consultation.  It will also be re-assessed for reductions that might occur with the team using cohort discovery, recruitment strategies, and evaluation of endpoint/power calculations.  The current budget seems in line with anticipated study costs.	The study proposes an enrollment strategy that includes the majority of sites (68) and patients (2400) located in Sweden to utilize the SwedeHF Registry.  U.S. based sites (52) are a much smaller component of the total number of patients (800).  This raises concerns over the generalizability of the results to the U.S. population. 20% CV mortality endpoint and associated power needs evaluation for the accomplishment of clinical meaningful results.  After an assessment of the patient populations using EHR cohort based assessment and supported queries from PCORNet, the team will be able to clarify this concern.  In addition, the team is using lessons learned from the data of the TOPCAT study to improve the study and make it more pragmatic.  The study is very solid, but will benefit from the additional suggestions provided by the TIC/RIC.	\N	\N	\N	171	This is an international study, with most sites in Sweden. Follow-up email received from Jamie Roberts: Hello,    I've just completed the online submission for the SPIRIT HFpEF Study, on behalf of Dr. Adam DeVore and the Duke Network Hub Liaison Team (nHLT).    The Duke nHLT reviewed the application with Dr. DeVore and approved it for submission to the TIN with just one caveat: We were not able to assist him with obtaining NCATS approval of the use of an additional network (in this case, PCORnet) prior to submission.     However, this did not preclude submission via the website portal and, given the timelines for Dr. DeVore's planned submission to NHLBI in early October we felt it was prudent to allow him to submit without explicit NCATS approval of the use of an additional network.    Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do on behalf of Dr. DeVore or the Duke nHLT.	To be provided by RIC.	\N

DATA MANAGEMENT & SITE MONITORING  Challenge: Collect all necessary data for analysis using brief, targeted data collection    Discussion Summary: A draft of one CRF document was reviewed and various data elements were discussed as to whether they were needed and/or how could they be refined.      Recommendations:   1. Create a log for types of fluid given; include volumes, dates & times of administration  2. Record name, date, and time of first dose of antibiotics administered  3. Define comorbidities and decide if pre-admission drugs need to be captured  4. Refine the types of fluids collected  5. Use a drop-down menu for the Site of infection data element, instead of a free-text field.  Rename this field Primary site of infection  6. Remove the Length of stay data element for each hospital unit.  Add dates and times of discharge.  7. Have the research coordinator upload any culture results for review that are not negative; Add: gender, randomization number based on envelopes, change age to DOB  Challenge: Which organization(s) will be responsible for the following tasks:  Developing the CRF, querying the data, performing site monitoring, and establishment of a DSMB?    Discussion Summary: The PIs were discouraged from further developing the CRF, since this is automated in current web-based electronic data capture (EDC) systems. In a multicenter trial such as this proposal, the data coordinating center would take care of managing the EDC.  This facilitates data quality monitoring and risk based site monitoring.  Recommendations:   1. The Utah TIC would function as the DCC to perform all data and study management.    2. The TIC would provide:      a. Data necessary to determine the amount of cross-overs      b. Remote site monitoring on an established basis      c. Write the charter and coordinate the DSMB meetings  3.\tInvestigate if the sites' CTSAs can perform local monitoring, leveraging their Hub architecture.  ___________________________________________________________    STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  Challenge: Is the current statistical approach best for this study?    Discussion Summary: A discussion on the potential for blinding occurred; however, this would take away from the concept of "pragmatic" and could make the project infeasible.  In addition, the majority of clinicians are aware of differences between the two liquids considered.  Adaptive enrichment of the study population was discussed.  However, such a feature would detract from the "pragmatic" nature of the trial.  Three types of allocation were discussed: patient-level randomization, site-level (cluster) randomization, and systematic allocation.  Patient-level randomization is clearly the best in this study.  Participant will be randomized using an envelope system as it is simple and allows quick randomization.      One of the main goals of the pilot study is to assess the level of adherence in each group, particularly in the LR group.  The original proposal was to look at comparing actual fluid proportions between arms, but it was decided that a better measure would be the proportion of patients for which a certain threshold proportion of fluid was reached.  In the larger study, the proposed sample size would provide enough power to detect varying potential differences (e.g., 4% mortality in NS group vs 2.5% mortality in LR group).  Subgroup analyses were redefined to ensure all subgroups could be classified pre-hospital admission.  The subgroups factors that will be considered for formal analysis are age, gender, cancer, and AKI/CKD at presentation.    Recommendations:  1. Do not attempt to blind physicians  2. Adaptive enrichment of the study population should not be done  3. Utilize patient-level randomization with an envelope system  4. Redefine subgroups for analysis to age, gender, and AKI/CKD at presentation    ______________________________________________________________    IND APPLICATION  Challenge: Does the TIC have IND application resources or should the IND application process remain at CHOP?    Discussion Summary: While the Utah TIC has resources to assist with the IND, CHOP currently has a group dedicated to helping investigators with the IND application.  The group will provide consultations and recommendations, as well as a liaison to the FDA contact.  Dr. Weiss has worked with this group and is preparing to submit the IND application the week of 03/06/17.    Recommendations:   1. Formally request a pre-IND review  2. Continue to work with IND group at CHOP	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	32	\N	\N	\N

\N	\N	The timelines are appropriate.  However, with a 1 year follow-up there is a possibility that the timelines could extend if subjects drop out and are not able to make it to the 1 year timepoint.  Currently, the synopsis does not state whether the primary or secondary endpoints will be based off of the 1 year timepoint or another timepoint.  If they are based on the follow-up visit (or even the 9 month visit) and the subjects are not staying in the study, it will be difficult to meet the timelines proposed.	Funding was not assessed.  The team put their funding together and submitted to PCORI prior to the initial consultation.   The amount presented seems appropriate for the study that is presented in the synopsis.	Overall the study design is very straightforward with a 1:1:1 design.  The retention for subjects for a full year follow-up could be difficult and the team should consider some incentives or retention reminders.  The study is still in a planning stage so it is anticipated that it will change.	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	The greatest challenges appear to be the self-identification inclusion criteria and the frequent subject visits over the 12-month study period.  The study team could benefit from the EHR cohort identification to help identify the additional sites for the study.	\N

\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	90	\N	Recruitment of this population is inherently difficult due to highly variable lifestyle of the target population. The PI and his team have put together a well thought out recruitment plan, including a comprehensive advertisement plan (print, tv/radio, social media), that will optimize recruitment and enrollment of participants.      Retention of participants is likely to be as or more difficult than recruitment due to the highly intensive clinic schedule and participant responsibilities once enrolled. It is our recommendations that more focus on retaining participants is warranted.	\N
\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	123	I followed up with Ryan Washington, who submitted the proposal on behalf of Dr. Bangalore, because he indicated that the proposal had not been reviewed by the CTSA Program Hub PI, but had listed Judith Hochman. He clarified via email that Judith Hochman is aware and supports the proposal.    This study does include international sites.

\N	\N	Timeline appears feasible and appropriate given the study design. Enrollment timeline is reasonable, given the number of sites planned, and based upon the investigator's past experience in pediatric clinical trials.	Project budget developed by study team was not discussed in detail at the initial consultation. This would be evaluated during the comprehensive consultation.	TIC team recommends evaluating the protocol and statistical analysis plan to optimize recruitment and enrollment.  Working with the sites to confirm the study will be important for getting sites activated.	\N	\N	\N	341	\N	Concerns were raised about the rate of enrollment for the trial, given the low frequency of BDP in this population. TIC team recommends evaluating the protocol and statistical analysis plan to optimize recruitment and enrollment.  In addition, there were some discussions around standard of care (SOC) at the sites and if there would be concerns from IRBs if sildenafil is SOC, but the protocol requires a placebo arm, if that would impact the sites that could participate in the study.	\N

Site-Based Optimization of Clinical Systems to Support Study Recruitment  Each recruitment site will leverage their clinical informatics resources to enable an automated screening algorithm which will be run against the health system's clinical data warehouse to identify eligible patients.  Data elements of interest populated in the electronic health record will be queried on a daily basis using a standardized computable phenotype which accurately identifies the population of interest.  The query output will come in the form of a patient list which will be electronically shared with the study coordinator.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	321	\N	\N	\N

Additional consultation related to design has been requested by the investigator.  We anticipate approximately 8 hours of additional time for a TIC investigator and TIC statistician to accomplish.   The cohort study is also potentially following the participants for up to 20 years, so retention will also be key. The RIC is proposing a MyCap application for participant engagement over the course of the study.	\N	Timeline appears feasible at a high level but re-evaluation will be necessary once RFA details become available. The additional follow-up period of up to 20 years is deemed necessary by the investigator given existing evidence for evaluation of Sickle Cell Disease, but may be challenging to accomplish given available funding and challenges with retention.	Budget is projected to exceed $500,000 in direct costs per year. PI has been notified and states he was already aware of additional requirements/timelines for submission given this fact. There is no current plan for engaging additional funding sources. NHLBI RFA is still pending and details of budget will be finalized once the details of the RFA are known.  Current budget is a ball park estimate of costs based on previous studies in this therapeutic area. Plans for the long term follow up after 5 years are in question until details of RFA are known.	Primary focus during the design consultation was on the improvement of Aim 2. The proposal described Aim 2 as a comparison of patients who had been on drug for a significant period of time to those just starting drug.  We found this approach to be challenging in that it may be too confounded with time and selection bias.  We suggested Aim 2 be addressed by selecting patients prospectively and matching them in some fashion. The investigator agreed in concept but continued refinement of Aim 2 will be needed to achieve a successful grant submission.  Aims 1 and 3 seem appropriate and achievable given the current parameters of the project.	\N	\N	\N	194	\N	\N	\N

\N	\N	Timeline appears feasible and appropriate given the study design. No major concerns with the proposal timeline were raised during the consultation by the TIC team.	TIC was concerned with the application of the larger scale trial within the R34 planning grant structure.  A proposed re-design to assess feasibility of the physician intervention is a more appropriate fit for the R34 funding mechanism.	Concerns were raised about the omission of death from the endpoints, feasibility of the physician intervention, and the ability to justify a waiver of consent for this design. The investigator was generally responsive to our concerns and provided either justification or agreed to adjust design to address the issue.	\N	\N	\N	250	\N	\N	\N

\N	Study investigators decided to withdraw the TIN proposal. They do not plan to submit for this funding opportunity due to bandwidth and timing concerns.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	402	\N	\N	\N
\N	\N	The timelines are best estimates.  As the protocol is further discussed and feasibility is received from the sites, a refined assessment of enrollment as well as close out for the study will be completed.	The team did not come with an initial budget.  The budget presented is provided from the TIC - this budget will be further refined as the study is further developed.	The study seems feasible .  Many details still need to be developed.  The TIC looks forward to collaborating during these discussions.	\N	\N	\N	49	This proposal has been pushed through for NCATS review. Please note that the investigator has indicated their proposal has not been reviewed by their local CTSA Hub PI.	RIC Recommendations if move forward to Comprehensive Consultation::    •       Feasibility Assessment based on the PPH NET  accrual at each site as compared to inclusion/exclusion criteria.    •\tDevelopment of recruitment materials and study information for Providers who may refer patients from outside the institutions.    •\tEvaluate level of appropriate compensation related to study participation vs standard of care    •\tDevelop strategies to help with subject retention and compliance (text messaging, reminder cards, birthday cards etc..,)    •\tAssess the workload related to trial management at the sites to see what degree of assistance may be required from ancillary study personnel (Research Coordinator or Research Assistant)	\N

The RIC team will re evaluate enrollment numbers every 3-6 months and provide additional recommendations based on results.	\N	The Grant extension ends March 2018.  Second Grant extension approval is pending. If the second no cost Grant extension is not approved the PI will not meet the enrollment goals due to the short amount of time left before the Grant ends.    As of 2/14/2018 the study is not progressing.  The PI was diagnosed with Lymphoma and is receiving chemotherapy.  The main coordinator resign and new coordinator has no research experience.  The two people who make the 48 hour follow up call after enrollment are mother and son and on vacation until March. The new site has been trained.  The PI is still awaiting news regarding the second no cost extension.  The project manager, Monica Olson will reach out to us when/if the study resumes enrollment and they need our assistance.

A robust medical ethics discussion between 2 distinguished ethicists at the University of Utah, the Utah TIC PI, and study PI was held on April 11th. Some key concerns were addressed, such as, the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in people with Cerebral Palsy and Spina Bifida. This will rise ethical issues when attempting to consent via self-registry. Consider a "teach back" method element in the online consent process. Potential subjects will need to correctly answer a few questions about the consent information before they will be approved for inclusion. Self-enrollment may complicate this issue, if the participant does not have the capacity to provide the consent that is being requested. Self-registering may also be a filter for someone who does not have the cognitive abilities and leave an important part of the population out of the registry. It was recommended to consider verifying identity with 2 factor verification when recruiting online.     It may be possible to get a legal representative to enroll the subject, but family members of those patients with disabilities may really discourage pregnancy. Concern that you may not get an honest answer about reproductive intent if legal representative learns disabled person is interested in reproduction.    Discussion that whole genome-sequencing is a complicated domain and advised that the study PI remove this from the initial grant (Spec Aim 5). Utah Ethicists brought up concerns around specific aim 2 and 5 at the initial consult meeting (on April 11th), which the study PI removed by the next meeting (on April 16th).	\N	\N	The current budget of $500,000 is too lean to accomplish all objectives of registry (even after the PI has removed 2 of the specific aims). Either the PI will need to limit registry ambitions or increase budget closer to a million dollars in direct costs.	\N	\N	\N	\N	297	\N	\N	\N

U01 timeline is in its early stages and will be built out as part of the R34 planning grant.	R34 grant submission is well vetted at this point and only appears to need minor adjustment incorporating experience from TIN resources.  R34 mechanism itself is appropriate for the proposed plan and has been discussed with NIAMS.  U01 budget will be developed as part of the R34 planning.	TIC team was comfortable with the general design of the studies.  A concern about the scarcity of data to support the non-inferiority design was raised as a consideration.  Recommended the team consider moving to a superiority design or a way to estimate clinical meaningful difference.	\N	\N	\N	318	\N	\N	\N

Study has already secured significant funding from the Arthritis Foundation to complete this Phase 1 trial. No concerns with the study design were currently identified, though detailed protocol has yet to be distributed. Financial concerns with CC budget present the only major barrier to trial success.  Though the investigator has limited experience with leadership of clinical trials, she is supported by investigators and researchers who have significant research experience, including Yuki Kimura and Sarah Ringold.  There are no concerns with the amount of time the investigator can spend on the trial.  The plan is for her to spend 25% of her time on this study.  The investigator has been very open to suggestions from the Trial Innovation Network and is eager to continue collaboration.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2017-11-14 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-11-01 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[dur_4___1]	[new_pre_3___1]	[post_3___1]	[new_pre_1___1]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[new_pre_2___1]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

The investigator has gathered sufficient preliminary data to inform this multi-site clinical trial. The investigator has been open to suggestions more experienced investigators and from the Trial Innovation and Recruitment Innovation Centers. Although the principal investigator, Bettina Cuneo, has limited experience for a trial of this size, she has partnered with experienced investigator Dr. Jill Buyon from NYU.  She and Dr. Buyon have recognized that the capabilities at University of Colorado to run a multi-site clinical trial are limited.  Thus they have sought help from the Trial Innovation Network to assist with both DCC and CCC operational components.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2018-03-08 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-02-26 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[dur_4___1]	[new_pre_3___1]	[post_3___1]	[new_pre_1___1]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[new_pre_2___1]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

DCRI will act as the coordinating center for the study. Both DCRI and the investigator have performed successful trials with the Pediatric Trials Network. The PTN performed a phase 1 study in 25 infants with sildenafil as standard of care and there were no serious adverse events. There is an IND for sildenafil, and FDA has requested a phased dose-escalation study such as the one proposed. Over the last 5 years, the appropriate dose range of sildenafil has been identified and echocardiogram has been validated as a biomarker for pulmonary hypotension in neonates.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2018-06-28 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	2018-06-15 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[dur_4___1]	[new_pre_3___1]	[post_3___1]	[new_pre_1___1]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[new_pre_2___1]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

The investigator is a distinguished clinician and researcher and has already made very significant contributions to cardiology as the inventor of abciximab, a platelet aggregation inhibitor used in patients undergoing PCI.  The investigator has been extremely engaged with the TIC and RIC teams and has included his team from Rockefeller in all discussions to date. In addition, the investigator is working with a number of clinicians and biostatisticians at his own institution and at other CTSAs to solicit their input on the study design.    The investigator is experienced in conducting clinical trials and has engaged with FDA and NIH (Mike Solomon at NIH is the PI for the Phase 1 study). The pre-IND meeting with FDA was positive, with FDA approving the general clinical plan for the development of RUC-4 via described Phase 1-3 trials.   The proposed Phase 2 study will address the challenge of treating STEMI patients in a timely manner by conducting the study in the pre-hospital and emergency department settings. The investigator is aware of the challenges of executing emergency care trials and has requested community engagement and feasibility analysis consultation/services from the RIC.

The PI has developed a team of experts from Neurorestoration Institute at the University of Rochester, the Burke Neurological Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine, and The Center for Adaptive Biotechnology at the Wadsworth Center in Albany. Three reasons for moving forward:   1) Novel efficiencies surrounding the trial structure proposal (i.e. adapting I-SPY platform to stroke recovery)  2) Energetic new consortium for first large multi-site project in need of consultation   3) High likelihood of funding given PIs' track records	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2018-08-23 00:00:00	t	t	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	t	\N	\N	2018-06-08 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[dur_4___1]	[new_pre_3___1]	[post_3___1]	[new_pre_1___1]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[new_pre_2___1]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

The PI plans to reevaluate approach with the feedback received by the TIN. There is no need at this time to move forward towards a Comprehensive Consultation. Grant submission deadline is early June 2018. However, PI is interested in receiving CIRB services and working with the RIC to come up with a recruitment plan, if funded.   The PI was incredibly engaged, attentive, appreciative and reworked some of his aims after some initial advice.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2018-04-09 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-03-26 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[]	[new_pre_3___1]	[post_3___1]	[new_pre_1___1]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[new_pre_2___1]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

The Investigator is an experienced trialist and has a strong research team, all of who have been extremely engaged with the TIC and RIC.  Dr. Barohn is a CTSA PI, and the PI on many federally and foundation funded clinical research studies for rare neuromuscular diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, inflammatory myopathies, and muscular dystrophies. He holds leadership positions in the Muscle Study Group and Western ALS Study Group, and thus has a great deal of experience working with investigators in multi-center consortium trials. He also holds the IND authorization for 4 drugs currently under study (mexiletine, methotrexate, arimoclomol and rasagiline).	t	t	t	\N	1	t	2017-02-21 00:00:00	t	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	t	t	t	\N	\N	\N	t	t	\N	2017-02-13 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[dur_4___1]	[]	[post_3___1]	[]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[]	[]	[dur_2___1]

The PI has been in contact with the NHLBI PO and they are interested in the study.  If investigator addresses concern in Aim 2 discussed in design concern section, chances of funding will dramatically increase. Due to the non-random geographic prevalence of the sickle globin gene, it is expected that a majority of participants will be of African descent.  This creates and opportunity for evaluation of a minority population that may be of interest to NHLBI as well as the TIN.  Dr. DeBaun is and established investigator with considerable experience with respect to Sickle Cell Disease.  DCC/CCC will be run through Vanderbilt and will provide the necessary operational support to successfully execute the study.	\N	\N	\N	f	1	\N	2017-09-18 00:00:00	t	t	f	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2017-09-11 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[dur_4___1]	[new_pre_3___1]	[post_3___1]	[new_pre_1___1]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[new_pre_2___1]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

The two investigators are highly regarded as two of the most talented young faculty involved in PECARN, and each is funded with a K award.  The Trial has reasonable chances of success in its application for funding.  If funded, the trial is virtually certain to be successfully implemented, both because of the investigators as well as the mature PECARN network.	t	t	t	\N	1	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	t	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	2017-02-03 00:00:00	[]	[]	[]	[]	[post_3___1]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]

The investigator has enthusiastic support from his CTSA PI.  Experience in leading multicenter trial is unclear. He clearly has time to carry out the study. He must wait until  the results of the ARRIVE study are available, which will be in January or February, so his submission date is no  earlier than February 2018. If the results of ARRIVE are "the right way", this will greatly increase interest in this  trial. If the results of ARRIVE are "the wrong way", then this study will not get funded. In the selection of sites, it  will be critical to assure that obstetricians have equipoise about the two arms of study.    UPDATE MAR 2018: Result of the ARRIVE Trial show that in "low-risk" pregnant women having their first delivery - maternal outcomes were better with induction of labor (IOL) at 39 weeks as compared to usual care with expectant management until 41-42 weeks. Rates of cesarean delivery and pregnancy-related hypertension were lower with IOL at 39 weeks. Baby outcomes trended strongly "better" with IOL at 39 weeks but statistical significance was just barely missed. So the conclusion from the ARRIVE Trial will probably be that IOL at 39 weeks in "low-risk" pregnant women having their first delivery provides better maternal outcomes without worsening baby outcomes.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2017-02-08 00:00:00	t	t	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2017-02-06 00:00:00	[]	[]	[]	[]	[post_3___1]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]

The investigator has been open to suggestions from more experienced investigators from the Trial Innovation and Recruitment Innovation Centers.  A review of NICHD feedback revealed the need for some design changes and the infusion of innovation to the design. The investigator is willing to make the changes needed to move forward with a successful resubmission and eventual implementation. The investigator has not previously been awarded for funding through NIH, but has completed a NIH funded trial awarded previously at his institution.  Investigator recognizes his inexperience with multi-center clinical trials is a disadvantage and wants to collaborate with the TIC and RIC to ensure success. Institutional support exists at UVA and time to provide oversight is not a concern.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2017-11-29 00:00:00	t	t	\N	\N	t	t	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	t	\N	t	2017-11-10 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[dur_4___1]	[new_pre_3___1]	[post_3___1]	[new_pre_1___1]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[new_pre_2___1]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

The proposal, study design is feasible to implement and is aligned with capacity and resources of the Trial Innovation Network. The proposal aligns with network mission/operational innovation.  IMMEDIATE-2 offers the potential for embedding a number of innovations, such as demonstration of efficacy in a clinical effectiveness trial, ECG based inclusion monitoring system with real-time recruitment feedback and monitoring, development of an EMS/ED OMOP based research repository for cohort discovery and monitoring of enrollment, use of a central IRB and central processes for emergency medicine research and the implementation of EFIC, metrics collection for trial performance monitoring and real-time improvement, investigating participation of CMS in funding model, and developing a marketing plan for non-patented treatment.  IMMEDIATE2 has the potential to promote the demonstration and/or dissemination of innovative operational approaches aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of clinical research (e.g., meta-trial of fully electronic data capture in the field to increase efficiency and adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria). The proposal is aligned with network resources based on sample size, number of sites, duration of support requested, as well as the stage of development of the Trial Innovation Network. The proposal includes opportunities for collaboration within the CTSA Program and across the NIH ICs.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2017-02-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-02-01 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[dur_4___1]	[]	[post_3___1]	[]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

This financial investment in the development of this project to date increases the likelihood that the UM1 grant will be successfully funded.  In addition, the history of scientific collaboration among these pediatric rheumatologists as well as the qualifications of these co-PIs leading this research enhance the likelihood of successful trial implementation.      COMPARE JIA will be conducted through the Childhood Arthritis & Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA), an investigator-led research network for pediatric rheumatologists in the US and Canada.  CARRA has 63 active sites and includes over 95% of all pediatric rheumatologists in North America.  The CARRA mission is to bring research opportunities to every child with rheumatic disease in North America.    CARRA has already successfully served as the foundation for multiple trials in pediatric rheumatology.    This trial will be led by two co-PIs, Laura Schanberg from Duke, and Sarah Ringold from University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital.      Dr. Schanberg was the founding steering committee member and is the current Chair of CARRA.  She was the PI for the APPLE trial, the largest randomized controlled trial in pediatric lupus performed in North America and the first clinical trial accomplished by CARRA.  She is also the PI for CARRAnet, where she has led the development and implementation of CARRA-wide informatics infrastructure enabling observational, disease-related data capture across 60 CARRA sites in the major pediatric rheumatic diseases, including 1000 children with SLE and 7000 with JIA, supporting standardization of treatment protocols, biomarker discovery, clinical trials, observational disease registries, and comparative effectiveness research.  In addition she is the PI for the PCORI funded PARTNERS network, a patient powered research network bringing together JIA and SLE patients, family members, and other stakeholders in a patient-centric model of collaboration that fully engages patients and families in decision making and governance to optimize the relevance and significance of research outcomes.  Overall, Dr. Schanberg has extensive experience and success in administrating large multi-institution NIH grants, working with CARRA sites, as well as clinical trials and patient engagement efforts that make her well-qualified and capable in both grant submission as well as successful trial implementation.    Dr. Ringold's primary research focus has been on outcomes assessment in JIA, with specific interest in disease activity assessment in JIA and the associations between disease activity and patient- and parent/proxy-reported health-related quality of life and fatigue.  Through her K12 award in Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER), she has gained experience in a variety of CER approaches, including pragmatic trial designs in the elicitation and incorporation of patient- and parent/proxy-reported outcomes including medication safety and adherence.  She has a comprehensive understanding of current practices in the treatment of JIA and developed the leadership skills necessary to successfully implement the proposed trial.      Further, this team has extensive experience and interest in employing operational innovations that improve the quality and efficiency of their trials. The CARRA studies have engaged in single IRB reliance, online consenting, and ePROs tools.  This team has administrative, operational, and data management experience running other studies through this registry.  These experiences may also serve as a unique learning opportunity for the TICs/RIC that could be studied and best practices developed for sharing through the broader CTSA network making this a mutually beneficial opportunity for both the study team and this network.      While the TIC/RIC and study team recognize that the trial may be challenging, conducting the study through the CARRA infrastructure and fine tuning the study design to optimize efficiency and quality through the comprehensive consultation will improve the feasibility and likelihood of success of the trial.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2017-02-27 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-02-13 00:00:00	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]

Trial has adequate support from key opinion leaders in the field and is designed with efficiency in mind. The investigator has more than adequate support from his institution and has sought their input on expertise in relation to TIC for the distribution of responsibilities for the best chance of success. All agree to TIC support of SA, CIRB, and DCC components of the study given experience level of the TIC.  The Northwestern data management and statistics groups are interested in learning from the Duke/Vanderbilt TIC with respect to managing a multi-site clinical trial.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2018-03-29 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-03-27 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[dur_4___1]	[new_pre_3___1]	[post_3___1]	[new_pre_1___1]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[new_pre_2___1]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

The investigator has been open to suggestions from the Trial Innovation and Recruitment Innovation Centers and has support through both his own institution (Vanderbilt) and the Huntington Study Group.  He has appropriately sought assistance from the Trial Innovation Network for design/statistical and budget consultation. The investigator has more than sufficient support at Vanderbilt to lead a multi-site clinical research study team.

There are scientific questions that must be satisfactorily  addressed in the grant submission, which is the main weakness. The hypothesis is that the intervention from  HALT A would have a persistent signal several years later, without any control of the medication that the cohort  has been treated with in the meantime. There are pros and cons to this hypothesis, and this would be the  ultimate question for the study section.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2017-02-08 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-02-07 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[]	[]	[]	[post_3___1]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]

The study team has been in contact with the NHLBI PO and they are interested in the study provided representation of U.S. population can be addressed.    Dr. DeVore will be a Co-Investigator on the project and will partner with Principal Investigator Eric Peterson and Statistical Investigator Kevin Anstrom.  Both Dr. Peterson and Dr. Anstrom have extensive experience with clinical trials in the cardiovascular therapeutic area and specifically with Heart Failure trials.       Dr. DeVore has been very appreciative of assistance from the TIC and RIC and is open to discussions evaluating trial design and strategy.	\N	\N	t	\N	1	t	2017-08-09 00:00:00	t	t	\N	\N	t	t	t	t	t	t	t	\N	t	t	t	2017-07-17 00:00:00	[]	[dur_1___1]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

Since there is currently little literature/research regarding this clinical diagnosis, it should get strong support from the medical community and the potential sites.    Overall TIC/RIC Recommendation is for:    1)\tThe PI to receive "services" in the form of a letter of support to accompany his re-submission.    2)\tConsider additional programmatic development under the direction of  the CTSA at Johns Hopkins.  His local institution and their resources can better marshal needed assistance to give the investigator time to organize his consortium and explore setting up a rare disease network in this area.  A future Comprehensive Consultation would be best informed by this additional work at Hopkins including development of an improved biomarker pathway to evaluate short term progress of the "RAFT type patient"  and development of a mentored relationship with a senior pediatric trialist at Hopkins.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	2017-11-16 00:00:00	t	t	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2017-10-27 00:00:00	[post_7___1]	[dur_1___1]	[dur_4___1]	[new_pre_3___1]	[post_3___1]	[new_pre_1___1]	[dur_3___1]	[pre_5___1]	[new_pre_2___1]	[dur_6___1]	[dur_2___1]

Yes  • Is the Trial likely to be successfully implemented? Yes  • Is the investigator likely to be successful, collaborative, and engaged? Yes  o Early stage PI who will require a lot of support and mentoring and with little experience in  leading a research team? No  o Overextended senior PI without adequate time to provide oversight to research team? No  NOTE: The application was submitted to NCATS but was rejected without review because of an appendix that  was judged to exceed page limitations.

Recommendation is for discrete services only.	\N	\N	\N	\N	(1) Site capacity for MAT therapy: The consult team suggested that the investigators utilize year 1 of the project to develop a list of outpatient providers. In addition, the investigators should discuss the following in the grant: site variability contributes to generalizability; describe the starting capabilities at each site and the feasibility of the collaborative care team approach at each site; include a description of a site-specific analysis and the advantages of site variance.    (2) The investigators stated that subjects will be surveyed at beginning and at end to measure sustainability. Outcomes will be measured via combined phone survey and claims utilization data to avoid observer bias. The consult team suggested that the investigators include in the grant application that participation in the study will provide subjects access to medications that can be difficult to acquire at or near the time of discharge. The investigators described that the claims databases are different across the 3 sites. The consult team suggested imputing outcomes based on the UCLA and UNM data that it may be worthwhile to capture pilot data to show feasibility of this data collection method, even if the numbers are small. The investigators will ask the UNM DCC if preliminary data exists.     (3) How does the TIC fit in? The investigators see the TIC as supporting oversight of network sites, implementing support, creating efficiencies, all allowing for improved allocation of resources and support of objectives. More discussion is needed regarding feasibility and budget allocation.    (4) Safety Assessments: The investigators described concerns regarding communication pathways between subjects and care teams and concerns of overdose between discharge and initiation of outpatient therapy. The consult team suggested that the investigators review the NIH scenarios describing what is research and determine if the design fits into a healthcare delivery paradigm to bolster the argument versus describing the project as an organizational change that is impactful but isn't exposing patients to various treatments. The consult team suggested that the investigators describe in the grant how the communication pathway with the usual care team and how the intervention will impact the usual care relationship.    (5) How long is reasonable to spend on adapting and implementing the CCT intervention? The consult team suggested that the investigators utilize year 1 of funding to establish and calibrate the teams at each of the three sites. Calibration should include case discussions with comparison of management strategies with a plan to measure fidelity, assess key skills, and identify areas of variability. The consult team agreed that 1 year for this task is reasonable and that the investigators should describe in the grant application how this task will be completed in year 1 with defined milestones and a contingency plan if more time is needed. This time could also be utilized to obtain an estimate of recruitment.    (6) Data collection and management: UNM will serve as the DCC. The consult team suggested that the best way to organize the CCC/DCC relationship is around a statistical analysis plan (SAP). Year 1 milestones could include developing the initial drafts of the SAP, data dictionary, case report form, and data integrity/monitoring plan. The consult team counseled that de-identified data sets should only be provided to the local sites or externally after completion of a priori analyses to prevent premature ancillary analyses.	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	Yes	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	126	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-07-11 00:00:00	Collaborative Care teams for hospitalized patients with opioid use disorders	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mary Stroud	\N	\N	490	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	An itemized budget was not reviewed during the consult. Discussions centered around financial support of TIC involvement. The consult team stated that the TIC award could support cIRB (not needed), standard agreements (needed), and innovations. The consult team counseled the investigators that operational innovations are typically explored during a comprehensive consultation, which requires more time than is permitted with the current grant submission deadline. If the investigators choose to delay grant submission to the November, deadline, a comprehensive consult could occur with exploration of collaboration and innovations. During the wrap-up call with the investigators, the investigators confirmed that they are moving forward toward the July 11, 2018 grant submission deadline. Recommendations: The TIC will provide education and support for standard agreements and for the cIRB at Cedars-Sinai and provide availability during the Year 1 planning period to assess feasibility and calibration of the local study teams. The RIC performed a technical feasibility assessment with each of the recruiting sites.  Sites were asked to complete an intake form and respond to questions relative to their local bioinformatics capabilities and resources.  Sites were asked to provide information on their local EHR infrastructure and an overview of their clinical data research resources that could support querying the EHR data to allow the RIC to provide a standardized recruitment protocol that can be enabled at each site.	t	\N	\N	453	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-05-08 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Collaborative Care teams for hospitalized patients with opioid use disorders: Translating evidence into practice	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	Master Agreements and Operationalize CIRB	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	[document]	\N	Yes.

The TIC and the RIC provided as much consultation as possible, to the satisfaction of the investigators, within the timeline permitted (proposal submitted to the TIN less than 60 days prior to grant submission).	676	Danovitch	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-07-20 00:00:00	\N	\N	2018-06-20 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-07-20 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The investigators asked to what extent could they rely on the local Liaison Teams to help with the initial work of identifying the population of patients with opiate use disorders (OUDs). This led to a discussion of real-time cohort identification versus retrospective electronic cohort identification. The consult team suggested that a RIC recruitment consult could be built into year 1 of the project. This recruitment consult would explore the use of both electronic cohort identification and innovative real-time patient identification utilizing electronic medical record alerts. RIC POC to discuss with RIC leadership regarding capacity, availability of resources, and letter of support for the grant application. The investigators will discuss further with the local Liaison Teams regarding resources available for coordinator and IT support.     During the wrap-up call on June 18, the RIC presented on possible solutions for leveraging EHRs at each of the recruitment sites. The RIC will draft a list of questions to send to each of the recruitment sites to determine local capabilities. The investigators agreed that a daily query of the local EHR would be sufficient with report of potentially eligible patients to the local study team for screening. The RIC stated that their NCATS funding would support this consultative approach.

Possible hypotheses to be evaluated in the comprehensive consult include:  1. Use of a mobile app for data collection and patient communication leads to an increase in data quality and patient retention over traditional methods.  2. EHR cohort discovery leads to higher performing sites cutting down on overall cost with a reduction in the number of sites needed.    Further opportunities to embed operational hypotheses will be evaluated during the comprehensive consult.	\N	t	t	t	Dr. Passman and team propose a prospective multicenter unblinded 1:1 randomized trial comparing continuous NOAC (novel oral anticoagulant drug) versus smartwatch-guided intermittent NOAC for lower risk patients with non-permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). Physicians will prescribe marketed NOACs, which currently include Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, and Edoxaban. The REACT AF subject population will consist of AF patients considered to be at a lower baseline risk of having a stroke, but in whom anticoagulation is still indicated under current guidelines. Only patients with a CHA2DS2-VASC score of 1- 4 (baseline stroke risk of 1.3 - 4% per year) will be eligible for this trial. Subjects enrolled will be limited to those with non-permanent AF, no prior history of stroke or TIA, no indication for a permanent pacemaker or implantable defibrillator, and currently prescribed and taking a NOAC medication. The study is expected to be conducted in approximately 120 centers located in the United States. Roughly 6,000 subjects will be enrolled in the study to ensure 5,260 randomized subjects. To exclude patients with a high AF burden, external ECG monitors will be used in the study to screen approximately 7,800 patients prior to enrollment and randomization, which assumes a 30% screen fail rate. Approximately 2,630 smartwatch devices will be used in the study for subjects randomized to the treatment arm. To ensure a widespread distribution of data, minimize site bias in study results, and ensure that sites will be able to adequately manage and follow subjects enrolled in the trial, the maximum number of randomized subjects allowed at a single site is 200. The enrollment period is expected to last approximately 24 months. Subjects will be followed for 30 months and then exited. Therefore, the anticipated study duration is approximately 54 months. Outcomes Measures are listed as Stroke (all), systemic embolization, death, and major bleeds by ISTH criteria.    Assessment:  REACT-AF is a well thought out and innovative study that stands to potentially change practice for patients with a-fib.  The most notable hurdle to overcome is the coordination of data as it relates to the flow of information from the apple watch to a regulatory-compliant EDC system as well as the feedback loop to the patient (via an app) once their data is reviewed pertaining to their NOAC prescription directive, along with patient confirmation of receipt of this messaging.  Currently, there is a 25 patient pilot study that is validating the algorithm for AF detection.  The results of this pilot study will become available in the coming weeks but the preliminary report suggests high sensitivity and specificity.  To augment this data, it was strongly suggested that the investigator composes data specifically on the error rate of this novel automated pathway and what value a human might have on these error rates as a consideration for inclusion of a core lab for real-time review and/or random auditing of the data.  It is also important to fully understand the historical control data for the physician assessment pathway against which this automated pathway will be compared.  It is essential that the new system operates at an error rate at or below the historical control currently utilized in the clinic while also not compromising the testing of the primary hypothesis.  Patients for this study will come from both electrophysiology lab centers as well as general cardiology practices that can refer patients to the study.  Given the small scale of the pilot study, potential enrollment rate may be difficult to accurately model.  As such, the trade-off between using the 65 core sites currently "signed on" versus expanding this number to a group of sites that may or may not recruit as efficiently needs to be considered.  This study has the backing of the FDA (verbal at this point but reportedly an IND "would be granted" if there is indeed high sensitivity in the pilot data)  to push for the change in labeling of the safety insert for these NOAC drugs. The NOAC labeling change would be to advise (if positive study) that there may be a safe way to intermittently takes these drugs without increasing the risk for stroke versus how the inserts currently read (e.g., a black box warning about not discontinuing therapy).    Recommendations:  •\tObtain historical error rates from AF diagnostic routine clinical setting compared to error rates associated with the Apple watch pathway from pilot  •\tConsider use of a core lab for selectively verifying AF readings throughout the trial.  •\tInvestigator needs to compile a list of sites for overlap with the CTSA network with potential expansion to more sites.  •\tInvestigator should develop plan for return of value & compensation (travel, time, etc.) for all participants.  Especially important in the control arm group who do not receive a smartwatch.  •\tInterim analyses need to be planned out with early stopping rules for futility.  •\tInvestigator needs to work with the watchband company, AliveCor, to determine messaging capabilities that can be built into their app software (vs. developing a stand-alone app).    Recommendations for Comprehensive Consult:  •\tEHR cohort discovery to aid in site selection and recruitment projections.  •\tFeedback messaging system associated with AF detection and NOAC directive needs to be created and validated.  •\tPilot data needs to be reviewed to determine error rates associated with the watch pathway and any implications it may or may not have on statistical analysis plan.  •\tAssessment and bootstrap modeling of the current statistical plan.  •\tSupport investigator in making IND submission related to the safety of trial's intermittent NOAC use.  •\tRecruitment materials specifically targeted toward referral pathway from general cardiologist practices.  •\tConsider/devise incentives for patients with a specific focus on control patients who would not receive a free watch.  •\tDetermine scales to be used (SF-12, SF-36, Duke anticoagulation satisfaction scale), the timing of assessment, and method of collection for QOL and healthcare utilization.  •\tcIRB planning is needed to ensure appropriate resources are available and to ensure multisite coordination plans include adequate human subjects protections  •\tREACT-AF budget will need to be reviewed and integrated with CCC/DCC responsibilities.	t	\N	t	2017-07-20 00:00:00	f	\N	The study has a large sample size and long duration.

The PI has shared a recruitment letter but no other recruitment materials have been developed (flyer, brochures, etc.). There is an existing recruitment and retention plan that is very detailed and it seems the study team has considered most of the critical components for successful study implementation. However, there are challenges in ensuring families understand the drug and that if they choose not to use the drug, it will not effect their medical care. The RIC could potentially help refine the recruitment plan, develop and revise recruitment materials, and potentially hold a Community Engagement Studio at Vanderbilt to gain feedback from parents of children with Sickle Cell Disease on study participation and key elements, such as recruitment materials and consents.	\N	\N	\N	482	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	5	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Consuelo Wilkins	\N	t	\N	\N	t	\N	2018-03-31 00:00:00	\N	2017-12-01 00:00:00	\N	1	\N	2018-03-31 00:00:00	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2020-02-28 00:00:00	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	237	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	There were no concerns regarding the overall budget.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	The original budget of $ 2.02 million appears to be adequate for this study.

The study is planning to recruit through the EHR to identify records of patients who may be eligible for participation. EHR Cohort may be able to benefit the study by assisting with site identification and also with participant identification at the individual sites and sending alerts for participation. E-Consents may also be something the RIC can help with to enroll participants. There is currently no recruitment plan in place or recruitment materials that have been developed, which are 2 services the RIC may also be able to help with. Study feasibility has also been discussed with the PI as he has increased his enrollment goal to 20,000.	\N	\N	\N	453	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Paul Harris	\N	t	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	2017-12-13 00:00:00	\N	1	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	246	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	f	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-12-31 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	NHLBI pushed back on the "control" patients and whether the ~13,000 estimated patients who will not be reclassified is truly needed as a prospective control group.

PI feels that the reviewers concerns can easily be addressed and plans to do so when they resubmit application for grant.  27-June-2018 Grant approval pending  2018-March-23 PAT reviewed proposal. Utah TIC PM emailed PI new Utah TIC Letter of Support for CIRB services.  2018-March-22 PI verified and emailed Utah TIC PM Letter of Support from "Injury Free Coalition for Kids."  2018-March-21 Utah TIC PM sent reminder email for Letter of Support from "Injury Free Coalition for Kids" to PI. PI verified that it is currently in route in the mail and once they received it they will email us a copy by March 22nd. PEDI-SBIRT is ready to be presented to the PAT on March 23rd. PI needs Letter of Support for CIRB services from the PAT asap (for grant application due April 5th).   2018-March-16 PI verified that they have a Letter of Support from "Injury Free Coalition for Kids" and they will email Utah TIC a copy as soon as they receive it in the mail.   2018-March-15 PI finalized 6 sites and completed the "TIC PI Prep List for CIRB Services."   2018-March-13 Follow-up email sent to PI and verified that all 6 sites are ED settings and that workflow will be nearly identical to that which was proposed to PECARN. PI is still in the process of finalizing 6 sites and filling out "TIC PI Prep List for CIRB Services," form before this can be presented to the PAT. PI will get back to us once that is complete.   2018-March-7 Sent initial contact email to PI. This PI is resubmitting proposal under new affiliation with "Injury Free Coalition for Kids" rather than PECARN, therefore this proposal will need to be presented to the PAT again.

The study also has a long treatment phase further impacting costs. The existing study design may be cost prohibitive in that the estimated initial budget is in the ballpark of $97M.  Given the high cost and relatively little human data on efficacy and safety, the TIC recommends the most appropriate next step for this research be a dose ranging study to determine the appropriate (lowest safest) dose for this drug in this patient population with a biomarker endpoint, with a shorter treatment period of six months and targeting approximately 30 sites and 500 subjects.  The budget for this study would be approximately $12M.	\N	\N	\N	2017-01-31 00:00:00	\N	\N	test	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	47	t	\N	\N	test	f	test	test	\N	PDE5 Study	\N	\N	test	\N	test	\N	\N	\N	Full scope = $12K per subject +$5K start up.

Following a review of all relevant materials and the initial consultation, our key recommendations, advice and guidance to Drs. Brittain, Brown and Wang (and their study teams) are as follows:    �\tTo help the study meet the recruitment challenges and needs we would encourage the study team to explore:  o\tA Community Engagement Studio focused on minority recruitment to help shape culturally tailored marketing materials, and retention and compensation methods. A useful guide to planning and implementing studios was provided.   o\tEnabling clinic patients to self-identify based on simple criteria, and submit information via a REDCap survey on tablets in waiting areas.  o\tTrial use of the CTSA sites social media pages, with targeted ads to the followers of the CTSA social media pages.   o\tTargeting some marketing materials at spouses and children of potential participants to expand the studies audience and deployment possibilities.  o\tLeveraging available recruitment tools like ResearchMatch.org, and repositories of patients which link their EHR and their willingness to be contacted for research.   o\tEncouraging retention and adherence to study drug, by making participants feel that continued participation is meaningful. This could include providing educational materials on lifestyle, and diet for people with diabetes and CAD.    �\tIn regards to a large multisite trial, we would propose that the team centralize the recruitment burden through remote access to medical records at the sites allowing the coordinating site to screen and determine eligibility remotely and the local site to use its resources to enroll.    �\tTo assist with site selection, the RIC has done preliminary feasibility counts at the RIC institutions for inclusion of: Diabetes II with ACS in the prior year and exclusion of: prevalent heart failure, prescription for long-acting nitrate. These counts demonstrate that the population of patients is available as described by the team.    �\tThe TIC is providing guidance for a reduced scale design for this project and so at this time the RIC would not recommend further RIC services. The RIC would welcome the opportunity to work with this study team on future submissions.	test	\N	test	482	\N	1	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	test	40	\N	t	test	\N	f	\N	\N	test	test	2	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Paul Harris	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Tiina Urv	\N	\N	\N	\N	test	\N	[document]	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	t	test	\N	\N	37	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	test	\N	\N	t	test	t	\N	t	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	test	\N	\N	\N	[document]	test	2016-12-20 15:47:00	\N	test	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	t	\N	0	f	test	\N	\N	\N	[]	[]	[]	[]

These patients will be evaluated/tested by physicians who will view the probability and severity of CHD sufficiently high to warrant invasive evaluation (American Heart Association /American College of Cardiology, AHA/ACC class I or II an indication for invasive coronary angiography). Exclusion criteria: prior anaphylactic reaction to iodine contrast; prior Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); severe congestive heart failure (New York Hearth Association, NYHA class IV); suspected or recent (within 6 months) Acute Coronary Syndrome, ACS; planned major surgery (necessitating interruption of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy, DAPT).   The Investigator proposes a 1:1 randomization to the two management strategies using a computer generated permuted block design and stratified by site. Patients randomized to the experimental strategy will undergo coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) instead of cardiac catheterization for assessment of their coronary anatomy. CTA images will be evaluated by the clinical team at each study site. Of central importance, will be assessment for high risk coronary anatomy, defined as the presence of left main, three-vessel, or two vessel coronary artery disease with involvement of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Only 25% of patients had high risk anatomy by CTA in the CORE320 study with a similar patient population as in CINEMA. If present, the patient will be referred to a heart team, consisting of noninvasive and invasive cardiologists, as well as cardiothoracic surgeons, for consideration of coronary artery revascularization. While not mandated, cardiac catheterization and invasive coronary angiography will be performed in most cases at this time. If no high-risk anatomy is present, patients will be assigned to an initial trial of medical therapy unless there is 15% myocardial ischemia on provocative testing, class IV angina, or reduced left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction less than 40%). If one of these criteria is present, patients will be referred to a heart team for consideration of coronary artery revascularization.  Patients randomized to the invasive strategy will undergo cardiac catheterization and invasive coronary angiography as planned. Angiography results will be evaluated by the clinical team at the study site and management, including the decision whether to proceed with coronary artery revascularization, will be implemented according to local practice. All study sites will be strongly encouraged to adhere to current practice guidelines.   The proposed enrollment estimate is 4,706 subjects/65 sites; ~2-5 patients per site per month which will dictate the number of sites needed.      Assessment:   CINEMA's first protocol was reviewed; there were no issues identified with the design of this study. The Investigator needs to articulate medical care adherence program with equipoise for both arms. A total of 4,706 subjects need to be recruited; therefore, the rate at which these patients occur at the target sites is needed. Also, as the design starts with equipoise at the point of recruitment, we recommend the Investigators consider running the study faster; this will result in needing fewer sites, if the recruitment yield is higher.  Most patients will be seen by cardiologists who will then make determinations whether patients need cardiac catheterization.  In order to achieve a higher recruitment rate, standard messaging strategies to the patients as well as physicians will need to be developed. Having a unified voice from persons making decisions is key. Once a patient has been referred to a surgeon for a procedure, it will be difficult to change the assigned pathway; the angiographer is not going to double guess the evaluation of the referring physician and the referring physician is not going to change his/her referral pathway. This will require training practitioners at the sites.    Recommendations/suggestions:   •\tBench mark data for overview of CINEMA endpoints vs. traditional endpoints   •\tFoster agreement between cores (JHU CT core laboratory and possible angiography core lab)  •\tInvestigator needs to work on version #2 of his protocol   •\tInvestigator needs to compile a list of the approached sites, the list should include attained response (positive, negative, etc.)  •\tInstigator should build a CINEMA Executive Committee, identify other leaders in the cardiovascular field (the investigator need to engage leaders, listen to concerns and input)  •\tInvestigator should rework their study design schema (confirm and add percentages through the diagram)    •\tInvestigator should consider having contingency early stopping rules for success that balance out the contingency futility rules, this would yield a broader degree of precision    Recommendations for Comprehensive Consult:  •\tWe recommend the investigator use the point of view and expertise of interventionalists to create a list of practice management, patient flow, site specific characteristics that will create barriers to robust enrollment (this list should be provided to the Recruitment Innovation Center-RIC during the comprehensive consultation)  •\tCentral IRB planning is needed to ensure appropriate resources are available and to ensure multisite coordination plans include adequate human subjects protections   •\tFurther discussion is needed to review CINEMA's study design       o\tBench mark data for overview of CINEMA endpoints vs. traditional endpoints        o\tDiscussion on Aim 3; Cost Analysis  •\tEHR Cohort Discovery is needed        o\tRun Electronic Phenotype; rate at which these patients occur at sites  •\tFurther discussion is needed on CINEMA's Statistical Analysis       o\tJHU TIC will review/redo power analysis        o\tExplore superiority and non-inferiority approach       o\tFeasibility of generating simulations of the composite scores   •\tFurther discussion is needed on adherence/medical management         o\tThe medical therapy needs to be further discussed       o\tAdherence strategies need to be developed        o\tHealth care delivery and institutional engagement needs further discussion  •\tStudio Engagement: Studio geared to patients and physicians/providers is recommended   •\tTo achieve recruitment goals physician education/training tools are needed       o\tConsenting methods (video consenting could be explored as an option)       o\tPhysician and patient messaging needs to be developed   •\tFurther discussion is needed on designing CINEMA's Virtual Core        o\tFoster agreement between cores (JHU CT core laboratory and possible angiography core lab)  •\tCINEMA's budget needs to be discussed       o\tPRA review and DCC/CCC roles	t	\N	t	2017-07-20 00:00:00	f	\N	Sample size and number of sites is very large.

The current plan is that each site would recruit 2-5 patients/month (compared to the other studies that have been done where there can sometimes only be 1 patient/month recruited). All this depends on the prevalence of the problem per CTSA demographic reach and the population density. Since there is a focus on stable angina (types 1 and 11a) the prevalence might be higher than in other studies they presented.  We recommend gathering prevalence and population density data (this would also include number of cardiologists in the region as well since they would refer for cardiac angiograms and this is the key person needed for a recruitment strategy).   •\tPatient Engagement. The current paradigm includes PIC, this is a key point to engage both providers and patients. Setting up a studio to inform the randomization scheme, recruitment messaging and return of value propositions.   •\tProvider engagement: Conduct interviews with 10-12 providers to inform the messaging strategy for physician buy-in across CTSAs, and inform the development of the screening and recruitment plan.  •\tEHR Cohort Assessment. Perform EHR cohort discovery at the 64 CTSA sites.  This will help the research team determine feasibility of working with the proposed sites.

Feasibility was difficult to assess since data is not currently available to review for enrollment in the registry from the previous year (will be available later this summer).  Recommendation discussed with the PI Dr Romer included:  •\tFeasibility assessment to be done at each site based on the previous year's enrollment of   the patient population into the PPH Net registry with application of the current inclusion and exclusion criteria  •\tThe need to create an enrollment plan for the project.  Dr Romer feels that currently patients will be recruited while an inpatient at the various institutions at the time of diagnosis.  •\tDevelopment of the protocol to enable the study visits to coincide with other standard of care visits to decrease burden on study participants and increase compliance and retention  •\tExplore the need for subject compensation related to travel, procedures etc..,  •\tReinforce the added value by participating in this study protocol (closer monitoring of their condition, return of study results)	Investigator seems qualified	\N	\N	482	t	2	\N	t	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	t	OVerall design and concept are feasible	\N	t	\N	f	feasible	Yes, this is a small study.	2	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	Paul Harris	\N	t	2	\N	f	\N	\N	2019-02-04 00:00:00	\N	t	\N	Tiina Urv	2019-01-25 00:00:00	f	\N	\N	Yes, small study with very good anticipated pediatric team engagement.	\N	[document]	\N	\N	t	\N	2020-01-31 00:00:00	t	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	t	Early stages but the potential is there	\N	\N	49	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	Can be developed and vetted during the comprehensive consult	t	\N	t	Operational innovation can be devised/embedded during the consult.

A hypothesis will be finalized as part of the comprehensive consultation.  Potential opportunities for operational innovation for which operational hypotheses could be designed include:   •\tEvaluation of educational strategies in a cluster randomized design with a provider intervention.  Assuming there would be 3 sites, each site could receive a different education strategy.  For instance, the groups could include 1) Initial education on-site with regular webinar education refreshers; 2) Initial education webinar with regular webinar education refreshers; 3) Initial education on site only.  We can then make between-group comparisons of physician adherence to intervention.	\N	\N	\N	\N	A working protocol was supplied by the investigator and only minor updates occurred during the initial consultation.  TIC expressed concern with absence of death within the endpoints and urged the investigator to consider using MSOFA as an ordinal outcome and add a new highest level for death. Though valid reasons exist for choosing a traditional cluster randomized approach, the TIC urged the investigator to consider a sequential, stepped wedge design to keep the number of sites at a manageable level.   Based on review of the protocol, lack of pre-existing evidence, and NIH concerns about feasibility of the intervention, the TIC recommended a feasibility study including a small number of sites to evaluate and refine intervention adherence.     In response to our concerns, the study investigator elected to re-design the protocol to reduce its scope to a feasibility study and bring it back for review by the TIC once adjusted.  Other commitments prevented him from making significant process between March and August.  Through regular follow-up communication he indicated more assistance with protocol and grant development from the TIN would be beneficial and indicated the desire to move forward with a comprehensive consultation.     The investigator stated he was advised by the Mayo IRB that a waiver of consent would apply in this scenario given the cluster randomized design.  However, some concern was raised by the TIC/RIC team regarding this approach, considering the collection of patient-level data needed to support analysis of the proposed outcomes.  Further explanation of the requirements and rationale for waiver of consent were provided to the investigator by the Vanderbilt CIRB resources.	t	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	The investigator has more than sufficient support at Mayo Clinic to lead a multi-site clinical research study team.  Sufficiency of his time to provide oversight is unclear for the originally proposed design, but the recommendations for reduction in scope to a feasibility study will make workload more manageable.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Point-of-care ultrasound study	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mary Stroud	4th quarter 2020	\N	466	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Initially questioned the appropriateness of R34 for the proposed study, but the proposed re-design to a feasibility study that would inform a larger study seemed more appropriate for this mechanism.	\N	\N	\N	482	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-01-15 00:00:00	\N	yes	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	Point-of-care ultrasound in the evaluation of the acutely ill patients	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	Initial consult: protocol design,   study budget, Recruitment and retention.	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	2019-02-01 00:00:00	Yes.

Therefore, our recommendations are not related to recruitment and retention for an identified study with specific inclusion/exclusion criteria but rather the recruitment of a community of individuals with a fairly wide range of demographics and health conditions. The sites shared that they have had minimal success with recruitment for past studies and expressed concern regarding the image of clinical trial participation.  Suggestions from the RIC included engaging their local recruitment/retention resources (CTSA or other),  promoting ResearchMatch and to start laying a foundation for research participation by engaging this community through social media, community events, support groups, clinic visits, etc prior to recruitment for any particular study. The study team also expressed concern about losing participant interest if the participant were to screen out of a study. Again, the RIC team pointed to ResearchMatch as a means to soften the blow of ineligibility as recruitment teams could share this opportunity (or other enrolling studies at that site) with a screen fail.	\N	\N	\N	453	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Terri Edwards	\N	t	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	2018-06-08 00:00:00	\N	1	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	343	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	t	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-06-30 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	The probaility depends upon the protocol to be designed.

Implementation of the 90-day start-up plan from JHU will improve overall site recruitment and performance compared to previous iterations of the trial and pharma trials in MS (Tufts-CSDD).    Evaluating strategies to incentivize recruitment at a site level with dashboard reports sharing performance metrics    Prospective reimbursement assessments to ensure medication coverage approval to reduce dropout due to lengthy approval times or lack of coverage    Piloting a fast-track system for patient appointment scheduling at tertiary care centers with historically long wait times    Electronic capturing of patient reported outcomes during follow-up visits to increase accuracy of scoring and validity of measure	\N	t	t	t	The protocol for this pragmatic trial was in a near finished state and well designed.  It was suggested to the investigators that benefit would be gained in the areas of start-up, data quality, efficiency of file transfer, and metric tracking to promote recruitment with performance dashboards using the VISION EDC system.  It was noted that the phase 2 trial preceding TREAT-MS took upwards of a year to get sites activated and as such, use of the JHU 90-day start-up program will likely lead to increased performance and efficiency for the overall trial.  It was also suggested that the investigators pull data from completed MS trials whether NIH or industry funded  to serve as benchmarks for areas such recruitment and retention.   Additionally, the price for medications used for treatment are extremely high and because of this, prospective reimbursement assessment will be done to try and ensure that all patients entering the trial are covered regardless of their treatment allocation.  Patient reported outcomes are a crucial component of this trial with known calculation errors in previous iterations of TREAT-MS.  We have proposed using a mobile app, electronic EDC capturing of these data fields to automatically calculate the scales and improve the reliability and validity of their key outcomes.	t	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	1	The JHU/Tufts TIC has the resources to support this pragmatic trial and the total duration of the trial falls within the TIN funding period.

We would suggest identifying from the sites that require a referral to reach out to their site marketing team/department administrators, and identify who sends the most referrals to their practice. Sites could heighten awareness of the study through sending communication to those referring centers.   b.\tAdditionally, in reviewing each participating site's website, every site has an easily accessible 'Research' tab/page. I would encourage each site to highlight this study on their research website. Contact numbers for each recruiting site coordinator and/or the Coordinating Center could be listed for ease of contact.   c.\tIn researching and reaching out to NephCure, it appears that we could leverage their patient registry network. I would recommend that the coordinating site pull information from the registry to try and identify patients that may meet criteria in the areas local to each of the hospitals. I would also recommend that the study be highlighted on the NephCure website.   d.\tLastly, consider engaging the NEPTUNE network that these participating sites are already affiliated with to notify others (via mail/e-mail/annual in-person meeting). If their colleagues can identify patients they see in practice, and the patient is within the area of a local participating site, perhaps they could refer the patient to the participating site. (This is likely the least viable option, but still may work to bring awareness to the study).  2.\tChallenge of Quickly Identifying Zonulin Levels in Participants:  a.\tIt appears that NYU will process all of the samples for Zonulin testing. If there is still concern on the timeliness of the sample processing, I would suggest shipping the ELISA kits to each site. I would recommend identifying the proper resources at each site to ensure that they have the ability to process these samples.   b.\tIf each site is unable to process their own samples, to maximize time, I would encourage overnight shipment of the sample.   3.\tRetention Challenges:   a.\tFor many of these families, the additional expense of increasing their weekly food expense is not feasible.

The new CPET approaches will be analyzed in terms of: 1) established indexes of health (e.g., body composition); 2) habitual physical activity, an emerging metric of child health; and 3) disease impact using standardized questionnaires and novel exercise-responsive gene expression signals in the circulating blood.  These children will be followed over a 3 year period.  In combination with healthy children as comparisons, the project will delineate the use of CPET biomarkers across a broad spectrum of pediatric health and disease. The study will take advantage of the grant cycle and study cohorts prospectively as participants grow and mature from Tanner 2-3 to Tanner 5, roughly a 3 year interval.	\N	\N	\N	2017-02-17 00:00:00	t	\N	\N	\N	Yes, the request for TIC/RIC services aligned and the Trial Innovation Network has the capacity to support the study.  While a small yet complex study, the requested services are limited and aligned with the stage of development of the network.    TIC Service:    CIRB service requested:  The number of hours for the service 15-20 hours.  The study is relatively small (3 sites/180 subjects) and all three CTSA hub sites have executed the SMART IRB agreement, and each confirmed experience with the single IRB model at their respective institutions and did not anticipate issues using the CIRB service through the Trial Innovation Network. In this circumstance, the requested service at the outset appears feasible and appropriate.  The responsibilities for the CIRB service will be with the Duke/Vanderbilt TIC, with Vanderbilt organizing and facilitating the process (with any needed support from Duke) as well as serving as the CIRB for the study.    RIC services:  Recruitment (Retention) Plan:  8-10 hrs.  Work with the study team to develop standard guidelines to increase retention in this age group (adolescents), provide recommendations for post study survey related to participant satisfaction and return of value.    Recruitment (and Retention) Materials:  8-10 hrs.

Areas of possible support discussed were use of social media to increase participant engagement, possible development of some study specific recruitment methods and materials that were geared to specific cohort, ethnicity or under-represented populations. Suggestions regarding recruitment and retention included:    -Use of social media (twitter, Facebook or study specific website), to increase retention by facilitating ongoing engagement with the study participants    -Inclusion of information related to healthy lifestyle (exercise and eating habits) that could be pushed out through twitter, along with updates to the Facebook or Website environment.    -Recruitment through the study sites general Pediatric Providers rather than community focused recruitment for the normal control cohort could also help increase retention.     -Scheduling study visits on the same day as other visits to the study institution to help mitigate unnecessary time spent away from school or work.	\N	\N	\N	482	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	No comments	55	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Paul Harris	\N	t	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Tiina Urv	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	82	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	f	\N	2	\N	Given the timing of the initial consultation and the submission deadline, there was not sufficient time to assess or provide input to the investigator for the projected budget.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	No comments	2017-02-01 12:29:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Based upon the initial feedback of reviewers, the study team revised and simplified the aims focusing more on the goal of producing achievable steps to transforming the use of exercise in child health clinical research and presented the role of each CTSA collaborator.  They reconfigured the clinical use-cases, now focusing on two pediatric chronic conditions, sickle cell disease (SCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF). These two diseases, both genetic in origin, are pathophysiologically quite different, yet each impairs exercise and physical activity across the lifespan in distinct ways. With the 'compare and contrast' opportunity of these two use-cases, an appropriate comparison group of otherwise healthy children, and by taking advantage of the funding period to follow the trajectory of CPET change across developmental stages Tanner 2-5, a critical period of growth and development, our statistical plan is now more robust. The 'collaboratory' has been reconfigured and now consists of three CTSAs with substantial programs in CF, sickle cell disease, and exercise science.	\N	\N	\N	No comments	2	\N	t	0	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	[new_service_selection___7,new_service_selection___4,new_service_selection___3,new_service_selection___1]	[issues___1]	[]

After the introductory call, a 60 minute meeting was held which consisted of a presentation describing the study and then an overview of central IRB services, given by JHM IRB director, Megan Singleton.    The CIRB services requested are feasible.  Four sites will be recruiting providers and participants and have already stated their interest.   No more than four sites will be open.  Help from their partnering network, the Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group (PCRC) will help with monitoring the study and with regulatory submission.	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2019-07-01 00:00:00	58	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	GoC HF	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mary Stroud	\N	\N	451	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	453	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-06-19 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Goals of Care Intervention in Advanced Heart Failure (GoC HF)	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	Operationalize Central IRB	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	451	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	499	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-10-12 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	2	\N	\N	\N	499	Dougherty	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-07-20 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-07-20 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Recruitment was discussed.

(PI required to resubmit proposal under new affiliation with "Injury Free Coalition for Kids" rather than PECARN.)  2018-March-5 PI responded and stated that PECARN will no longer move forward with their study. PI also shared that they now have a new affiliation with "Injury Free Coalition for Kids". PI will need to reapply through the TIN for a letter of support for CIRB services due to change in new affiliation with "Injury Free Coalition for Kids" rather than PECARN.  2018-March-5 Utah TIC POC sent Letter of Support to PI & finalized summary report. PI needs grant funding approval before we can move forward with CIRB services.  2018-March-2 PAT review of study and recommendations approved  2018-Feb-27 Utah TIC POC sent email to PECARN PM to get finalized PECARN sites to add to summary report and PAT slides  2018-Feb-15 Completed Initial Call with PI. Only interested in CIRB services.

Perhaps set a time-frame (on TIN website) of how far in advance PI's must request certain services such as CIRB and Standard agreements.

The RIC has offered to provide additional recruitment tools/ resources. Utah TIC offered to schedule a "kick-off" meeting if PI is interested in recruitment resources from the RIC. PI mentioned that they do not want to schedule a "kick-off" meeting if it is not a productive use of their time. Currently awaiting confirmation/response from PI in regards to scheduling a "kick-off" meeting.  8- Dec- 2017: Utah TIC sent Follow-up email to PI with identified priorities and action items  7-Dec-2017: Initial Call complete. Unique situation with potential for mixed funding from both industry and federal funding. Currently sponsored by Horizon Pharma with condition to begin enrollment by end of the year 2017. Federal funding pending. UAB has local IRB approval and plans to begin enrollment as the lead site this month. They are interested in CIRB services for sub-sites, recruitment help in identifying CTSA sites (in order to reach enrollment goal), and Standard Agreement services. Utah TIC, RIC will following-up internally to verify if any of UAB conditions are "show stoppers". UAB will confirm with Utah TIC next week if they are NOT receiving federal funding.  4-Dec-2017: Utah TIC sent F/U email to schedule "kick-off" meeting  29-Nov-2017: Utah TIC sent email in attempt to schedule "kick-off" meeting in advance  29-Nov-2017: Scheduled initial call for 7-Dec-17 at 1:30pm MST (2:30pm CT)  28-Nov-2017: Utah TIC sent F/U email and heard back from HLT POC  21- Nov- 2017: Waiting for email response from PI to schedule proposal review call	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	236	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	[]	[]	[]

These include: 1) Utilizing the RIC Recruitment and Retention Plan to proactively plan out strategies, 2) Raising awareness of the study among clinic staff through regular face-to-face meetings, 3) Creating culturally relevant recruitment materials in Spanish and displaying these in patient waiting areas to allow participants to self-identify, 4) Ensuring there is sufficient effort allocated for bilingual/bicultural study personnel so they have time to be engaged and interact with participants throughout the duration of the study, and 5) Developing a plan to evaluate recruitment and retention strategies throughout the study.      The staffing for a study coordinator or personnel to meet with and recruit participants appears to be a bit thin, and the study team has not allocated any money for recruitment materials.	\N	\N	\N	453	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	20	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Paul Harris	\N	t	\N	\N	f	\N	2019-03-01 00:00:00	\N	2018-08-02 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	385	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	f	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	0	\N	f	0	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	[new_service_selection___9,new_service_selection___4,new_service_selection___2]	[]	[]

IMMEDIATE-1 and IMMEDIATE-2 use a clinical diagnosis plus defibrillator measures of cardiac ischemia to identify correct patients. During the IMMEDIATE-1 trial, aspects of this process were built in to defibrillators, but this will not be available in IMMEDIATE-2. A key aspect in IMMEDIATE-1 was feedback on accuracy of recruitment adherence to the local sites; this required a weekly manual data transfer process back and forth from each site. The AVERT trial's current approach to data capture was described, including using the software "Digivey" as a platform for real time data capture, central management, and integration across multiple sites. The possibility of using the AVERT/Digivey approach for IMMEDIATE-2 was discussed, and it was determined this might be a beneficial trial innovation. Connecting EMS Defibrillators directly to the IMMEDIATE-2 data center for real time data capture could be possible. The proposed innovation was to piggyback a data capture "meta-trial" on top of the planned IMMEDIATE-2 trial. This meta-trial's goal would be to address a secondary trials innovation hypothesis focused on improving correct trial patient identification. Real-time central data capture combined with central, real-time management of enrollment criteria could lead to fewer false positive and false negatives recruitments, as well as more efficient site management and feedback.    A. Recommendations to Principal Investigator PI    1. Consider direct connection from EMS devices to local database so that the data are transferred in real time.    2. Consider linking to more a comprehensive data collection structure, such as extract data from EPIC.  3. Consider clustered randomized trial on 2 different initial data collection procedures. Group 1 will consist of real time transfer from EMS with central data management and Group 2 will consist of existing local model. The purpose of this is to see if these procedures improve accuracy and pace of recruitment.   4. The feasibility, innovation effect size, and effect on recruitment can be modeled utilizing the weekly site screening and recruitment data over the time course of the Immediate 1 trial.  The Immediate 1 trial leadership will have to decide if they wish to have the above "innovation" embedded in their trial.     B. Recommendations for a Comprehensive Consult     1. The PI could consider using a piggyback "innovation meta-trial" of centralized management of field data capture process if this project was carried forward to a comprehensive consult. In this approach, half of the sites would be allocated to receive the standard data feedback loop and the other half would be randomized to a fully electronic feedback approach. The real time feedback loop is a potential trial innovation. This project will be able to test the hypothesis that the real time feedback loop will lead to more accurate adherence to trial enrollment criteria (fewer false positives/negatives) and improved site management (shorter time to full recruitment capacity).     Topic 2: Statistical Analysis Plan Discussion Summary       There are 3 composite outcomes for the primary endpoint: 1) Mortality 30-Day, 2) Cardiac Arrest, and 3) MI Infarct Size for the proposed study.  The non-parametric method of Finkelstein and Schoenfeld will be used to calculate the difference in treatment groups in this composite endpoint. Comparisons are made for the outcomes in all pair-wise patient combinations. For example, a mortality for one patient is scored higher when compared to patients who have a cardiac arrest or the other patient's infarct size in the absence of death or cardiac arrest. In contrast, the scores are equivalent if the patient pair has the same outcome event.      Simulations to estimate the power of this study were done using data from IMMEDIATE trial. Hopkins statistical consultants asked to see details of these simulations if it is appropriate to share these results.     Discussions centered on the study populations. In the initial study, the patient population was taken from in pre-hospital setting. Problems occurred with this approach because treatment with the GIK occurred too late in some cases. For the proposed IMMEDIATE 2 study, the patient population will also include the people coming to the ED (about half of the patients come to the ED in ways besides arriving in an ambulance). The median time to treatment in the pre-hospital setting (first trial) was 90 minutes and IQR 30 minutes to 2.5 hours. It is possible that there will be a difference in time distribution in the ED versus pre-hospital setting.    A. Issues Identified    1. A simple randomization method to assign patients to treatment arms is proposed. However, concern was expressed about potential chance imbalances in major prognostic factors.  To prevent potential imbalance in important prognostic factors, one possible solution is to use covariate adaptive randomization (see Pocock SJ and Simon R. "Sequential treatment assignment with balancing for prognostic factors in the controlled clinical trial." Biometrics 1975: 31: 103-15).      2. Finkelstein-Schoenfeld (FS) method - Concerns were expressed that any imbalance in prognostic variables can't be controlled for in a multivariable model given that the FS method is a non-parametric method. However, the FS outcome can be computed under stratification.    3. Concerns were raised about possible controlling for the multiple comparisons as many outcomes seemed to overlap among the primary and secondary specific aims.     4. There was some concern expressed on the data used to estimate the effect of GIK on heart failure used in the power analyses. The investigators based the estimated effect size on 10 studies, representing different treatment regiments. Concerns were raised that the number trials considered is small, and that the infarct size is on the study level and not the individual, patient level. However, this issue was given a lower priority since there was a feeling that the analytical methods used by the PIs on these data were innovative, and that the data from these 10 studies was meant to supplement data obtained from the IMMEDIATE 1 study.      B. Recommendations to Principal Investigator     1. It was suggested that the analytical text note a stratified FS statistic by important prognostic factors will be calculated if imbalances in the randomization are identified.     2. It was recommended that a 3x3 table be created that describes the joint probability of each pair-wise outcome combination that includes mortality, cardiac arrest data, and use of infarct size data. A similar table has been reported on the consort diagram in the original trial for infarct size.  This data would benefit planning and grant review, making explicit the distribution of the outcome measures in the composite score.    3. Further investigation should be undertaken to consider if one of the three endpoints might dominate the power of the study as well as the final analyses, or if these three outcomes are equally informative on the composite endpoint.     4. It was recommended that mortality times, with uncertainty, could be estimated for patients who are censored, and alternative FS scores calculated using these mortality estimates. These alternative scores can then be compared to FS scores under censoring as a way to determine how sensitive the FS methods is to the censoring of mortality.      5. It was recommended that weights be applied to calibrate the distribution of pre-hospital data to make this comparable to the time-to-treatment distribution that we might expect to see in the ED setting.       6. If this project is awarded with a comprehensive consult we could review the power sample size simulations described in the statistical analysis plan.	\N	\N	t	2017-01-31 00:00:00	t	\N	\N	\N	OVERALL TIC Recommendation to move forward with Comprehensive Consultation/Implementation: Study not recommended for comprehensive consult.

The JHM TIC CIRB will be able to serve as the IRB of record for this study.  The study PI and team are aware that in order to initiate CIRB services that an acceptable community consultation plan will need to be created and the full protocol and consent form will need to be reviewed and approved.    The principal investigator is aware that potential study sites need to be identified and interested sites will need to agree to use the SMART IRB exchange and JHM TIC CIRB.  The study PI and team are aware of these factors and given the timeline for grant submission and funding, adequate time is available to develop these aspects of service readiness.       How many hours will the services requested require?    The time requirement for this study will be tracked in real time to provide time estimates for future studies.      How will the services requested be supported with regards to infrastructure and institutions (who will carry out activities)?   The JH TIC and TIC CIRB have staffing in place who are knowledgeable and trained to handle new research projects coming to the TIC with processes in place and forming.

Standard Agreement services are feasible.  The coordinating center for this study will not be the JHU TIC, therefore standard agreements for each identified study site will be provided to the study PI for use.      How many hours will the services requested require?    An estimated 1-2 hours of work will be required, per study site participating.     How will the services requested be supported with regards to infrastructure and institutions (who will carry out activities)?   The following staff members will facilitate drafting standard agreements for each proposed study site and provide these agreements to the study PI:  •\tGayle Walters, Director, Office of Research Administration, JHU  •\tCindy MacInnis, Research Navigator, Johns Hopkins Trials Innovation Center    IMMEDIATE-2 Study: RIC Services    Are the services requested feasible?  Electronic-based cohort discovery, recruitment feasibility plan, and community engagement studio will be supported by the Vanderbilt Recruitment Innovation Center.     How many hours will the services requested require?    Electronic-based cohort discovery:  50 hours (EHR-based recruitment, 30-hours, and Heart station interrogation method, 20 hours)    Recruitment feasibility plan: 20-40 hours  •\tAssessment of EHR data (outlined below - including estimated hour breakdown)  •\tAssessment of eligible vs. enrolled subjects from the previous IMMEDIATE Trial to determine enrollment barriers, 10 hours  •\tDevelopment of study specific recruitment strategies to increase enrollment of eligible subjects, 10-30 hours      Community engagement Studio: 37 hours  Time needed for recruiting and preparing the community experts varies depending on the population of interest and the expert preparation.     Community Navigator/RIC staff:    •\tPlanning and preparation meetings/email communication with research team:  2 hours  •\tRecruitment and preparation of community experts:  10 hours  •\tMeeting logistics: 2 hours  •\tSet up, implement and closeout of the CES: 2.5 hours  •\tPreparation of written summary: 1 hour     Facilitator:   Outside of the Navigator's time, costs associated with the CES include:  Facilitator fee: $200 (Facilitator time includes prep meeting with researcher, prep/review of facilitator's guide, facilitation of CES - approx. 3 hours)     Community Expert compensation: $400-$500 (8 - 10 experts x $50)  Food:  $170 (approx. $13 per person x 13 people)  How will the services requested be supported with regards to infrastructure and institutions (who will carry out activities)?     These services will be supported by the Vanderbilt Recruitment Innovation Center. Dr. Paul Harris with support from Dr. Sarah Nelson will lead the Electronic-based cohort discovery service. Laura Yearsley with support from Mary Stroud will lead the development of a recruitment feasibility plan. Israel Tiffany will facilitate the community engagement studio.     If the proposal/grant becomes funded, are there plans for the services to be funded (or partially funded) through their awarded grant?  No, these services will be fully funded with the by the Vanderbilt Recruitment Innovation Center.	\N	\N	174	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	495	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	2017-10-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	Comprehensive Consultation/Implementation	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-10-16 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	2	\N	\N	\N	489	Selker	\N	\N	2	[document]	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-06-12 00:00:00	\N	\N	2017-01-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-06-05 00:00:00	\N	\N	2018-08-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Topic 4: Recruitment Innovation Center Support Discussion Summary    Feasibility using EMS and ED ECGs and heart stations; Community Engagement to identify and address potential issues in trust, transparency, return of value were the key points of this discussion on this consult. Dr. Selker is asking for RIC input/assistance with feasibility, monitoring enrollment, and community engagement. Dr. Paul Harris suggests that enrollment monitoring assistance may not be necessary based on previous experience from the original trial. He also recommends developing a recipe for site level numbers for recruitment. Dr. Paul Harris also suggests RIC support to aid in refinement of recruitment plan to reduce friction if possible.  Dr. Yvonne Joosten suggests that community consultations revolving around a local plan, trust/transparency, and return of values be considered. Waiver of consents might be an issue if trust not established. She also suggested that addressing potential concern for being in placebo group instead of intervention.  A. Potential Elements to Evaluate  Ease of access and availability of heart stations and ECGs or data warehouse to obtain data for feasibility assessment; how to best streamline recipe to access data due to heterogeneity across sites; community acceptance of waiver of consent; return of value from participation in trial    B. Questions for the Principal Investigator  1. How was feasibility assessed across the sites in the original trial?   2. Is there or will there be a recipe to follow to gather data on feasibility?   3. How will the community be approached in terms of outreach?   4. Have you considered how to address the return of value?   5. How will the concern to get the intervention rather than placebo be addressed?   6. What are some other areas of community input?    C. Issues Identified   Heterogeneity across sites when collecting feasibility data; Refine recruitment plan to reduce friction between systems (field-based vs ED based); Creating a relatively universal recipe on how to collect data from heart stations; Addressing the public's concerns regarding return of value, patient-centered outcomes    D. Recommendations to Principal Investigator PI   The investigator team should create a phenotyping algorithm for use by potential sites with access to historical EHR data - regional heterogeneity (data types/accessibility, coding practices, tools) will need to be considered in time, but starting locally with a phenotyping algorithm will be a good start for next-step feasibility assessment with other sites.  The investigator team should also create a 'recipe' for reviewing potential cases based on data that could be queried directly from heart stations --- here the recipe should include any sort of post-processing required from a potential data dump and/or assumptions around data use agreements, etc.   Consider community engagement on establishing trust, return of value.    E. Recommendations for a Comprehensive Consult:   Recruitment planning and feasibility; Community Engagement.	\N	\N	\N	482	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	55	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Paul Harris	\N	t	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Tiina Urv	2019-03-31 00:00:00	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2020-04-01 00:00:00	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	15	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	f	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	2016-11-28 13:35:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	During this consult, a budget was not reviewed, funding assessments are in progress with NHLBI.	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	f	0	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	[]	[]	[]

\N	\N	8,504,177	Yes, the study team anticipates 30-40 CARRA sites will be recruiting participates for this study.  During the initial consultation the team supplied a draft list of 41 potential CARRA sites and 31 of the 41 were CTSA sites (76%).  All of the sites in the draft list were located in the United States, however in discussions with the PI, they anticipate having 0-2 sites in Canada for this trial.  In addition, this trial would offer the opportunity to collaborate with NIAMS.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	2022-12-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	This trial seeks to inform the clinical care of JIA patients through inherent pragmatic features, as well as innovative operational approaches that streamline trial design and efficiency in clinical trials research.    Yes this trial presents several opportunities for innovation that are aimed at increasing quality and efficiency in clinical research:  o\tRedeveloping the study design to an adaptive/SMART design to best account for the multiple treatment arms and answer the clinical question with as few participants as necessary (streamline protocol, increase efficiency and reduce costs)  o\tUsing the existing infrastructure and EDC of the CARRA registry and supplementing only the study-specific data variables will streamline data collection  o\tUsing a centralized IRB with sites experienced in single IRB reliance model will streamline study startup activities  o\tAligning the standard of care clinical assessments and lab collection along with broad inclusion criteria will enhance generalizability, facilitate enrollment and translation of study results into real-world practice    Employing the above-identified strategies will improve the efficiency of clinical trials, increase the quality of the data produced, and ultimately inform the clinical care of JIA patients.  The operational hypothesis(es) and associated outcome measures will be further refined/defined during the comprehensive consultation process.	\N	\N	\N	\N	COMPARE-JIA will be a multicenter, randomized study with pragmatic features comparing the effectiveness of combining a biologic treatment with MTX to MTX monotherapy as first-line therapy for poly-JIA.  COMPARE JIA will be the first JIA clinical trial to include multiple biologic agents with distinct mechanisms of action. The importance of including different biologics in the same trial is illustrated by the ADACTA and AMPLE trials that compared biologic therapies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and provided useful data to help providers and patients choose among biologic therapies in adults. Because the anticipated difference in effect sizes between biologic agents in poly-JIA is small, adequately powering a trial to detect these differences is not feasible. However, the inclusion of multiple biologic therapies in the same trial will enable direct comparison of the biologic therapies in exploratory analyses.   The outcome measures include ACR Provisional Criteria for CID, ACR response criteria (ACR50), and Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-- a composite measure of disease activity, including physician and parent global assessments, active joint counts, and inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP).      The current randomization scheme is four treatment arms (1:1:1:1) of MTX alone or MTX plus CTZ, ABA, or TCZ.  Randomization will be stratified based on steroid use.  At three months, if ACR50 response is not achieved, the current protocol allows a treatment switch.  Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.      Current challenges with the study design include:    a.  Should we consider biologic monotherapy? Novel in pediatrics, may reduce side effects; may increase acceptability to families (1 shot v. 2 shots)    The feedback from the TIC was to make this decision based upon the science and weighing the risks and benefits of eliminating MTX compared to marginal acceptability gained by giving 1 shot v. 2 shots. In addition, the study investigator indicated that through surveys to the Childhood Arthritis & Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) sites, there was a preference for combination therapy by the other investigators.    b.  Should we consider earlier endpoints? Results at 12 months may be difficult to interpret with the current design (especially the treatment switching), an earlier endpoint could optimize data collection for patient trajectory analysis, and could be supplement with additional follow-up and data collection within the CARRA registry    While the timing on the endpoint was not fully explored at this initial consultation stage, the group did discuss exploring the selected endpoints.  The current primary endpoint is clinically inactive disease at 12 months as a binary variable (i.e., disease or no disease).  The team discussed whether or not this outcome measure can be used in a more summative way to better characterize different degrees of disease activity and lead to better statistical power.  The current design is also using the ACR50 response (50% reduction in joint involvement) and the JADAS, which provides grading of disease activity based on a 0-35 score; however, these other measures are currently in validation phases.  If this proposal moves forward to comprehensive consultation, these outcome measures will be further evaluated to identify the most sensitive outcome measure for this trial.    c.  Are blinded joint assessments really needed? (NIH requested blinded joint assessments but this could be a barrier to feasibility because it is harder for smaller sites to have another provider available to complete blinded joint assessments)    The need for blinded joint assessments should be driven by the standards for clinical research practices for pediatric rheumatology trials and was not specifically addressed by this team.  However, the barrier to feasibility may be addressed by focusing on recruiting sites at the larger CTSA institutions with sufficient providers available to accommodate the blinded assessments.     d.  A major challenge in the design is the option to switch treatment at 3 months.     The biostatistician for the TIC recommended considering a more innovative study design such as the sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART), or another adaptive intervention model to drop treatment arms rather than the treatment switching at Month 3 for non-responders.  If this proposal moves forward to comprehensive consultation, the biostatistician recommended that the study team set the clinical goals and then engage the resources of the TIC and the CTSA Bayesian design swat team at Vanderbilt to collaborate and review the pros and cons of various designs to assist this team in developing a design that answers their clinical question(s) in the most efficient manner possible.	\N	\N	\N	2017-01-31 00:00:00	f	\N	\N	\N	The study size (230 subjects at 30-40 sites) appears to be a good fit for the network at this stage.  As noted in the risks section, the timelines run parallel with the funding for the TIC grant; while it is anticipated that the last visits will occur in 2022, the final clinical study report/publication is projected for June 2023. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that during the comprehensive consultation the study design will be re-defined and further refined to determine the best approach to answer the clinical question at hand with the fewest number of subjects, thereby reducing the enrollment period and other associated costs for this clinical trial.       Regarding alignment with Network resources, this is a smaller study with pragmatic features.  While the design may be complex (with multiple treatment arms), the benefits of which are discussed earlier in this report, the implementation should not be as this study will be run through an existing infrastructure with opportunities for innovation and operational excellence.      Regarding alignment with Network goals, this study is actively engaging in pragmatic design features and seeks to employ innovative methods to achieve quality and efficiency in clinical trial operations.  The size of the study is appropriate for an early full implementation project for the Trial Innovation Network and presents learning opportunities for this network that could be implemented in other larger scale projects at a later stage of the network.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-10-01 00:00:00	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-11-01 00:00:00	Intro JIA	\N	2017-10-31 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Rhonda Kost	none of these dates are exact, as this is preliminary.	\N	502	per patient $50/visit for parking/mileage, $25/visit for time, patient education materisals= 668.85, patient recruitment/retention booster = 5853.12	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	This team currently has a U34 planning grant from July 2016 to June 2017.

Questions for the RIC from the Co-PI's  A) Suggestions regarding how to better track # of new onset patients at potentially participating sites so we can develop an accurate recruitment projection;   B) Development of recruitment materials and tools to assist sites getting patients enrolled at the same time they are getting a diagnosis that they may find devastating - this is hard for both the parents and the doctors.    2. Recruitment and Retention Challenges:       A) Feasibility  1. Individual site feasibility to:               \ta. Identify where participants will be recruited from (local site or referrals)                       \tb. Identify if investigators are willing to enroll participants into the treatment arm.  There                            is concern that investigators might withdrawal participants at time of randomization if they do ot                           agree with  the treatment assignment.              c. Identify if current data within the CARRA registry would be of benefit to this study.  Similar               data is already being collected so how can this be leveraged to attract investigators.    B) Recruitment Materials and Tools:                \t1. Families are newly diagnosed and will need extensive information regarding JIA.  Families                            will need to have a clear rationale for study enrollment and how this might provide potential                            benefits to their child.    Following a review of all relevant materials and meetings, our key recommendations, advice and guidance to Dr. Schanberg and study team include the following:  � We would encourage the study team to explore:    \to Conducting a 'pipeline' study that compares current requirements for participation (i.e.                           inclusion and exclusion criteria) with the existing CARRA Registry Database.  The CARRA                           Registry is a volunteer registry collecting data on JIA patients.  By comparing, Dr. Schanberg's                           inclusion/exclusion criteria to the existing CARRA  data one could ascertain the number of                            participants meeting Dr. Schanberg's criteria. This   pipeline study would provide the necessary                           evidence supporting site selection.                            o. Conduct a feasibility study with a small number of sites within the CARRA Registry to                            determine if the physicians will volunteer to agree to follow the treatment plan.  If this proposal moves forward to a comprehensive consultation, the Recruitment Innovation Center                                   could provide assistance in conducting the needed feasibility assessments for this trial.

PI hesitant to proceed with 1) RIC EHR-based cohort assessment service as he is looking for very highly specialized sites and clinicians (with dedicated gout clinicians, substantial patient populations of refractory gout, and considerable experience infusing pegloticase - an uncommonly utilized therapy for severe gout) that he has already identified, and due to the PIs aggressive timeline.    The RIC also offered assistance with 2) recruitment materials, as well as 3) additional recruitment advice and recommendations from the RIC toolkit. Again, presumably due to the aggressive timeline, the PI hesitated to proceed with assistance in these areas.	\N	453	\N	482	\N	1	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	40	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Paul Harris	\N	f	\N	\N	t	\N	2017-12-18 00:00:00	\N	2017-11-21 00:00:00	\N	1	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	No.	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	2019-04-01 00:00:00	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	236	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	f	t	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	0	t	t	0	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	[new_service_selection___1,new_service_selection___2]	[issues___4]	[]

Trial design discussion included the preferred use of a superiority design given no multi-centered clinical trials to date have been done to show that prednisone is efficacious in treating neurosarcoidosis.  For the sake of sample size it was discussed that a 1:1 ratio would increase power in this limited sample size population of patients provided equipoise exists and no practice tendencies lean toward us of infliximab over prednisone among the consortium members.    Another trial design was proposed in which 3 arms would be used in order to include a true "control" of no therapy after 4 weeks of prednisone use (up to date recommendation) in order to increase the anticipated effect size and therefore reduce sample size/increase power.  Due to ethical considerations, Dr. Aksamit does not believe this is a viable option as he and many of the members of his consortium believe in treating patients with prednisone for a minimum of 3 months with some extending to 6 or even 12 months.      Yet another design discussed was a response adaptive design in which the randomization allocation would be dynamically altered to favor the more beneficial treatment ("play the winner" type approach).  With this design a higher ratio of patients would be randomized in the end to the best treatment promoting recruitment in a disease where consequence of failed therapy remains high.    With a seemingly finite number of patients available for this rare disease in the 9 site consortium, use of a safety and/or biomarker endpoint to power the trial was discussed as it may be the only outcome in which proper power can be obtained to detect a difference before moving into a larger phase 2B or phase 3 trial.    These study designs along with other recommendations outlined below will be discussed with the consortium members to determine how they wish to proceed.    Recommendations:  1.Determine what current practice looks like at the 9 sites for treatment of neurosarcoidosis in terms of dose and duration of prednisone and how often a switch is made to infliximab as well as frequency of use of infliximab from the start  2. Confirm equipoise for proposed duration of treatment of prednisone vs infliximab  3. Consider powering on a safety and/or biomarker endpoint which in turn is correlated with a clinical outcome rather than a  clinical outcome itself which may be underpowered even in a 1:1 superiority design  4. Once deciding on basic elements of trial, draft the protocol with consortium to facilitate work in the comprehensive consult  5.

The language was clarified in the STRESS trial reliance packets.  •\tSites did not understand that they could, and should, begin the surveys while the reliance agreements are being executed.

This study provides unique opportunities for the RIC (in collaboration with all stakeholders) to develop novel engagement strategies for emergency medicine studies to address the specific recruitment challenges faced in this area.

To do this, 2-3 additional sites would likely need to be added in order to complete recruitment within the planned recruitment timeline. The Investigators estimated that powering the study at 90% power (and increasing the sample size to approximately 4,346 from 3,268) would require 2 additional sites and an additional $180,000/year which may not be financially feasible.  -EFIC Activities: During the initial consultation, it was noted that EFIC activities would not be likely, although possible. The UC-Davis IRB required a somewhat atypical, hybrid EFIC model for the pilot study. The budget includes Y1 support for each site in the event EFIC is required, but these funds could be re-allocated if it is not required.   -Current budget assumes imaging data management is being handled by UC-Davis. If this were to be managed by Utah TIC and data coordinating center personnel, this would be an additional cost above current budget.   -Current budget (of 5M) assumes Investigators will be allowed to go above the cap, but it seems more likely that this budget will go in under cap at <500K/year (2.5M total over 5 years) restricting funds to half.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	-CIRB services can contribute to the CIRB initiative which can provide data and metrics related to CIRB operationalization.	\N	\N	\N	t	-RCT to study evaluation strategy using abdominal ultrasound (FAST) vs strategy without.  -Planned participating site total: 6 (5 CTSA, 1 non-CTSA, all PECARN sites)  -Planned sample size: 3,268  -Recruitment Timeline: 3.5 years    -Recommendation: Consider powering study to 90% (from 80%), increasing sample size, and adding 2-3 additional sites in order to finish recruitment in allotted timespan with additional patients.	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	1	-No (DCC Services ).

The proposal also provides opportunities for operational innovations which will be further developed during the comprehensive consult (please see below).      Given the potential difficulties in recruiting and retaining cognitively-impaired subjects, we would like to further explore, in the comprehensive consultation, operational innovation around the following:    1.\tConsenting process - innovations related to obtaining informed consent, to include exploring the feasibility of video consent and/or materials directed at the patient's family  2.\tRemote Source Document Verification - using our advanced EDC/eTMF tool, explore the value of conducting intensive remote monitoring   3.\tRetention strategies - explore the potential of having automated patient visit reminders generated by the EDC while preserving PHI confidentiality.  4.\tAdherence Strategies - to improve on the expected dropout rate of ~25-30% from prior studies in this population.   5.\tSite Selection - explore the benefit of robust site qualification to include collecting census data, pre-selection team interviews, etc.  6.\tSite performance management - explore the benefit of aggressive site performance management (monitoring periodic recruitment as a percentage of census/investigator commitment, data quality measures, etc.) as the trigger for on-site monitoring, CAPA programs, retraining, site replacement, etc.      Potential operational hypotheses to be evaluated during comprehensive consult:    The ability to embed hypothesis in the trial is dependent on funding as well as a thorough assessment of the potential impact on the core study. Generally, the submitting investigator was amenable to ideas such as the following:    1.\tConsenting: To test the hypothesis that enhanced screening tools would be associated with fewer screen failures, we could embed a randomized assignment with half the sites getting advanced consenting tools in the first 100 patients, then a cross-over in the second 100 patients, finishing the remaining patients with whichever approach had the lowest percentage of screen failures.  2.\tRemote source verification - Again, differences in site monitoring could impart a bias, so this would need to be compared against historical studies in a similar population, if any are available.  3.\tAutomated Visit Reminders - given the hypothesis that an automated visit reminder system reduce missed/OOW visits, we could explore a similar cross-over design, this time randomizing within each site (with all patients providing contact info to preserve non-identifiability).  4.\tAdherence Strategies - previous studies in this population have a dropout rate of ~25-30%, adherence strategies implemented in the early phase and late phase of the trial will decrease the previously observed dropout rate.   5.\tAggressive Site Selection/Aggressive Performance Monitoring - this could be a randomized design to test the hypothesis that aggressive site selection/Performance Monitoring (if assigned) in half the sites results in faster enrollment, better quality, etc.  With only 10 sites, analysis of this data would likely need to be made in conjunction with other studies, and the potential for this to bias the study must be further explored.	\N	t	f	\N	A formal protocol was not reviewed. An assessment of current study design, project timeline and feasibility was performed using the previously submitted grant application.  Since the proposed recruitment rate is very aggressive, it is recommended that the Investigator use cohort discovery to address / assess   this potential problem. Participant retention could also be a potential problem as a ~25-30% drop out rate is anticipated. This dropout rate could be attributed to many patient and disease factors, including withdraw from study due to drug related side effects.  Although side effects themselves are not of concern, the Investigator should consider providing additional information to participants about the type of potential side effects expected and the length of time these are expected to last. A thorough plan to assure adherence should be developed. Exclusion and inclusion criteria of this study were discussed. Diagnosis of diabetes is an exclusion criteria; however, individuals with levels between 6.5-6.9 mg/dl pre-diagnosis could still be included in the study.  The biological single outcome of metformin and how this is manifested in biomarkers and imaging was discussed with the Investigator. The Investigator discussed that to-date there are no real gold standard outcomes in measuring global cognitive change versus focal cognitive change in Alzheimer's.  However, biomarkers are stronger than neuropsychological changes using MRI to measure total brain volumes, and is a good clinical surrogate to find evidence of cerebrovascular disease. The Investigator is using MRI measurements as outcomes, and comparing them to cognitive assessments. With regards to the cognitive assessment, the issue of learning effect was discussed.  Although the learning effect is well established and accepted in this field, it was suggested that the Investigator considers adding a run-in period so that all participants start from the same base level.  Since the reviewers will most likely look at this trial as an explanatory trial, the Investigator should go for a clinically meaningful difference and build in sub analyses for a plausible difference.    Recommendations to Investigator:    �\tComplete analysis of brain volume from pilot data   �\tSpeak with industry contacts about placebo manufacturing   �\tThe Investigator was encouraged to initiate a discussion with NIA regarding TIN utilization  �\tThink about pooling data from other trials to judge changes in dose/response   �\tIf the Investigator chooses the comprehensive course and it is approved, then a detailed plan for DCC development with the TIC DCC should be undertaken and use of TIC eCRF be considered.        Recommendations for a Comprehensive Consult:    �\tEHR cohort discovery to identify number of sites needed to reach recruitment goal   �\tFurther background work on global vs focal change and correlation with global and focal brain volume measures  �\tAssist in the development of a budget  �\tFinding study sites (survey CTSA sites for target population)   �\tFinding a research pharmacy and assistant with procurement of drug and matching placebo (this will be a join effort Columbia, JHU-Tufts, and CTSA)  �\tAssist with cohort identification    The proposed statistical plan from his PAT application as well as the Investigator's 2013 grant application were reviewed and accessed.  The primary aim is to compare changes from baseline to 24 months.  The Investigator should consider adding in intermediate time point as well, i.e. measure the primary outcome between the currently proposed times of Baseline and Year 1, and between Year 1 and Year 2. This approach may also lead to less lost-to-follow-up since the subjects are contacted more frequently.  However, a more frequent cognitive function testing such as every 3 months would increase a potential bias due to the learning effect.  A possible solution could be to explore 'Run-in' times to help create a level playing field in patient familiarity with the outcome assessments.  It is recommended that the Investigator explores performing a longitudinal analysis for ADCS and Recall test (as it is a global measure for identifying AD/Dementia) for multiple domains. The Investigator should also consider including treatment by time interaction terms in the longitudinal regression analyses to compare group differences in trends over time Power analyses could be potentially performed on the expected differences in slopes by groups. Adherence to intervention was also discussed, and the Investigator should consider performing a sensitivity analyses to account for lost to follow-up data, which potentially consists of non-ignorable missingness.      An important effect modification that the Investigator should consider is a difference in treatment response by APOE genotype, since it is well known that APOE-e4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD (identifying amyloid in the brain). Younger people may have different effects. The Investigator should consider doing additional power analyses on subgroup differences. These power analyses could possibly be informed by the means and standard deviations from published studies. Since not all patients will stay in 1000 mg dose, it is not clear on how this will affect the results.  One possible solution is to consider dose modifications in the longitudinal regression model.        Issues Identified:   �\tCorrelation between biological to primary outcome (exploratory analyses on biomarker)  �\tInformative censoring: missingness/lost to follow-up that is 'not missing at random' could be a potential problem (i.e. the population health can decline fast, leading to missingness due to unmeasured declines in cognitive functioning).   �\tThe expected dropout rate is high at ~25-30%. The Investigator should consider ways to decease this lost to follow-up in the study design.   �\tIssues with intervention/testing: Not all patients will get MRIs. Only about ~50-60% would undergo MRI based on availability and willingness (i.e. patients need to lie down, claustrophobia could be a barrier, time commitment as the scans take 2-3 hours per patient), potentially leading to a loss of power in the secondary outcomes of brain measurements.  �\tPotential of unintentional crossover should be considered.   �\tLearning effect - a potential learning effect bias with repetition needs to be considered.         Recommendation for Comprehensive Consult:   �\tAs part of the comprehensive consult the JHU-Tufts TIC, the statistics group could replicate the simulations from the pilot study (to address issues of adherence, crossover, and event rate).  �\tStatistics group could perform power analyses of effect modifier to assess heterogeneity/homogeneity.  �\tFinally, the statistics group could help the Investigator refine the statistical analysis plan.	\N	\N	t	2017-01-31 00:00:00	f	\N	I believe the study is aligned with the capacity and resources of the Trial Innovation Network.

I am not clear why the costs are so high, especially since MRIs will only be conducted in ~50% of patients. To be competitive in peer review, the budget will need to be reassessed. I believe the study team is qualified and can work with JHU collaboratively to carry out this study.	\N	Yes - the study has potential for success.  \tMoving from a pilot study of 80 participants at one site, to a 600-participant multi-site study will be challenging, so strong attention to recruitment and retention will be important.	\N	2017-06-29 00:00:00	2	2018-03-01 00:00:00	2018-01-01 00:00:00	t	t	\N	\N	0	\N	The study has potential; the scale up from the initial small study to 600 will have to be supported  scientifically in peer review. The recruitment and retention issues are significant; engaging AD Centers of Excellence may be key  as they dominate referral in some locales.	t	\N	\N	2017-06-29 00:00:00	\N	\N	2019-01-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	Given the potential difficulties in recruiting and retaining cognitively-impaired subjects, we would like to further explore, in the comprehensive consultation, operational innovation around the following:    1.\tConsenting process - innovations related to obtaining informed consent, to include exploring the feasibility of video consent and/or materials directed at the patient's family  2.\tRemote Source Document Verification - using our advanced EDC/eTMF tool, explore the value of conducting intensive remote monitoring   3.\tRetention strategies - explore the potential of having automated patient visit reminders generated by the EDC while preserving PHI confidentiality.  4.\tAdherence Strategies - to improve on the expected dropout rate of ~25-30% from prior studies in this population.   5.\tSite Selection - explore the benefit of robust site qualification to include collecting census data, pre-selection team interviews, etc.  6.\tSite performance management - explore the benefit of aggressive site performance management (monitoring periodic recruitment as a percentage of census/investigator commitment, data quality measures, etc.) as the trigger for on-site monitoring, CAPA programs, retraining, site replacement, etc.      Potential operational hypotheses to be evaluated during comprehensive consult:    The ability to embed hypothesis in the trial is dependent on funding as well as a thorough assessment of the potential impact on the core study. Generally, the submitting investigator was amenable to ideas such as the following:    1.\tConsenting: To test the hypothesis that enhanced screening tools would be associated with fewer screen failures, we could embed a randomized assignment with half the sites getting advanced consenting tools in the first 100 patients, then a cross-over in the second 100 patients, finishing the remaining patients with whichever approach had the lowest percentage of screen failures.  2.\tRemote source verification - Again, differences in site monitoring could impart a bias, so this would need to be compared against historical studies in a similar population, if any are available.  3.\tAutomated Visit Reminders - given the hypothesis that an automated visit reminder system reduce missed/OOW visits, we could explore a similar cross-over design, this time randomizing within each site (with all patients providing contact info to preserve non-identifiability).  4.\tAdherence Strategies - previous studies in this population have a dropout rate of ~25-30%, adherence strategies implemented in the early phase and late phase of the trial will decrease the previously observed dropout rate.   5.\tAggressive Site Selection/Aggressive Performance Monitoring - this could be a randomized design to test the hypothesis that aggressive site selection/Performance Monitoring (if assigned) in half the sites results in faster enrollment, better quality, etc. With only 10 sites, analysis of this data would likely need to be made in conjunction with other studies, and the potential for this to bias the study must be further explored.	\N	Areas of focus associated with this consultation related to recruitment issues including feasibility of the recruitment plan and potential issues related to participant recruitment and retention.     Identified challenges/needs:  Feasibility:  �\tTrying to generalize from a pilot study of 80 participants at one site, to a 600-participant study at ten sites is highly risky. There are many assumptions in making this leap that need to be made explicit if we are going to have more confidence in using the pilot data to make the extrapolation to the application. The grant application currently does not provide enough data to support that the current recruitment estimates are realistic.  Recruitment & Retention:  �\tMaking the study attractive enough to potential participants and their study partners to take a 50 percent chance on medicine vs. placebo will be a challenge.  Perceived equipoise has been shown to be an important contribution to recruitment success.  �\tPeople with changes in their memory often are either not aware they are having changes, or think these changes are part of normal aging. This can make recruitment for pre-MCI and MCI studies a challenge. Incorporating this factor into recruitment strategies should be explicit.   �\tThe study requires each participant to have a study partner. The study partner has many responsibilities, which includes making sure the participant is taking the study medication/placebo, and answering questions about the participant's medical history and changes in memory and mood. This presents both challenges to recruitment and retention.  �\tThe duration of the study (24 months) in itself also poses challenges for booth recruitment and study retention.  An accurate estimate of attrition is important to estimating statistical power and the required number of participants needed for recruitment.     Following a review of all relevant materials and our RIC Support meeting, our key recommendations, advice and guidance to Dr. Luchsinger and study team include the following:  Feasibility:  �\tWe encourage the Investigator to ask for more information from each of the individual site to show that the current recruitment estimates are realistic, and to include this information in the grant application. We suggest that the Investigator requests/includes the following information from the sites:  o\tA flow of patients that fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Detailed information about the inclusion/exclusion criteria are critical for estimating patient flow into the study.  However, we realize that this information is often difficult to obtain.  Where it is not available then modeling estimates would be important.  o\tPrevious recruitment history.  Again, this needs to be specific if it is going to be useful in making comparisons between these data and the predictions in the application.   o\tHow participants are approached and consented.  o\tHow cooperative the sites have been with the Investigator's site in past studies. This should be quantified, if possible.  o\tParticipants' attitudes toward research.  �\tWe would also recommend that the investigator address how the study will be attractive enough to potential participants and their loved ones to take the 50 percent chance of medicine vs. placebo.  �\tFor incentive payments, we would propose that the Investigator justify this in terms of time spent and financial incentives.  The research finding on incentives is not clear but some evidence indicates that larger amounts do work better; however, larger amounts are also related to perceived risks associated with the study.  Moreover, some studies indicate that payment, in contrast to lotteries, are more cost effective.  �\tIf incentive payments are going to be used then the study should include testing the participants on their knowledge of the risks associated with the study to help convince IRBs that the incentives are not 'undue influences' on the participants' judgments.  �\tIn terms of retention, we would recommend that the Investigator include more details about the retention plan in the grant application.    Recruitment & Retention:  �\tThe investigator has chosen sites with extensive experience in cognitive studies, including NIH-funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. In addition, we would recommend that the investigator choose sites with experience in minority recruitment as well as active ResearchMatch sites.  �\tTo help with participant identification, we would recommend mapping inclusion/exclusion criteria to easily identified EHR variables. We also encourage the study team to create recruitment materials/messaging that are directed to loved ones of those with memory changes, with clear messaging of which symptoms to look for, a study description, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.  �\tTo make the study more attractive to potential participants, we would encourage the investigator to consider a 2:1 randomization of study drug to placebo (rather than 1:1). However, we realize that this reduces statistical power so that the tradeoff needs to be made explicit.   �\tTo make the study more attractive to study partners, we would suggest paying them for their time and effort and possibly as an incentive as well.  �\tFor retention efforts, we recommend that the sites have planned strategies for building and maintaining relationships with study participants and their study partners. This includes regular check-ins, appointment reminders, birthday and holiday cards, newsletters, fact sheets, websites, and connections to helpful clinical and community resources.   �\tWe also recommend considering other areas to return value to participants. These include the option to return validated health results (with participants and their physicians) that would not interfere with the study.	This seems to be well thought out and has the potential to meet the aims of the project.  It is a strong team with a good track record.	\N	It is not clear from this write up what the proposed operational innovation hypothesis is.	453	t	1	\N	t	t	1	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	Strudy design appears to be feasible.

There are numerous areas where the Trial Innovation Network could be impactful, as well the trial could employ a number of CTSA sites.    At this time, however, the investigator has requested a few more weeks to finalize his grant strategy before proceeding to comprehensive. I am approving contingent on the investigator deciding to move forward. Given the desire to delay, I would, therefore, rate this as a lower priority, with priority to be re-evaluated by the TIC against other projects that arise in the interim.	\N	\N	\N	[]	[]	[]	[]

In doing so, a more complete assessment of the range of clinical practices currently surrounding diagnoses, treatments, and associated outcomes with concussion will able to be evaluated.  The current landscape of these practices is wide and as such it is crucial that Dr. Bazarian utilizes his own concussion clinic and perhaps a few select others from CTSAs to better inform the practices to determine which ones represent a majority of the range that exists thereby allowing a more focused approach to trial design and data reporting structure.      As such it was recommended to Dr. Bazarian before moving to the comprehensive, that he utilize his local CTSA resources to survey the existing data at the concussion clinic at Rochester.  From this inspection Dr. Bazarian was able to provide a table of assessments that begins to capture some of the range of practices that can be seen even in his own local clinic.  It was also suggested that he used this time to survey some of the CTSA sites to obtain contact information for their respective concussion clinics and assess interest from his potential collaborators.  This effort resulted in a list of nearly 30 CTSA concussion clinics that expressed interest in being a part of this consortia.  The plan as we move into the comprehensive consult is to use the momentum gained from this outreach to involve some key opinion leaders from this group to play an active role in the shaping of this proposal.    Some other recommendations/focus areas for the comprehensive consult include:    - EHR cohort discovery to gain a better understanding of the number of sites needed  -perform a similar data inspection to what Dr. Bazarian did at rochester and his clinic at a few other centers to better inform the design and sample size calculations  -think about ways in which we can leverage similar EHR platforms (namely EPIC) to extract data directly from the electronic medical record to compare to conventional prospective entering of data by study teams into a cloud based EDC system  -Survey anticipated sites to determine who has the capability to collect various biomarkers/imaging as part of regular practice to expand the domains of investigation at a minimal added expense  -Assess the current 50+ factors being looked at for potential interrelatedness in hopes of trimming down the list to a more manageable databank	t	\N	t	2017-02-14 00:00:00	f	\N	\N	\N	Yes the JHU/Tufts TIC has the capacity to support.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2019-10-01 00:00:00	11	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-10-05 00:00:00	Concussion Clinical Trial Network	\N	2019-10-15 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	3	2025-10-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mary Stroud	\N	\N	447	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The investigator is hoping to keep the proposal to under the 500k cap but depending on sample size, number of sites, and intricacies of the data collection is aware that there may be a need to discuss submitting over the cap.

Most of the patients seen in Dr. Bazarian's outpatient clinic setting are direct referrals from athletic trainers and pediatrician/PCP offices but we will want to determine the referral process at other participating sites. It will also be helpful to have an estimated time from injury to initial visit in the concussion clinic as Dr. Bazarian would like to enroll before 6 weeks post-injury, which is the first window for follow up. Dr. Bazarian is looking to the TIC and RIC for help to identify sites in order to develop the network and also to determine the volume of patients seen at each clinic. The PI is also seeking help in participant identification/enrollment processes and recruitment materials.	\N	\N	\N	453	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	t	2017-02-15 19:22:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Consuelo Wilkins	\N	t	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	2017-10-05 00:00:00	\N	2	\N	2019-10-31 00:00:00	t	\N	\N	\N	2023-10-31 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2023-10-01 00:00:00	f	\N	\N	2019-10-31 00:00:00	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	114	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	t	\N	2	2018-09-30 00:00:00	The investigator is hoping to keep the proposal to under the 500k cap but depending on sample size, number of sites, and intricacies of the data collection is aware that there may be a need to discuss submitting over the cap with NINDS.

No major concerns noted.  Protocol clearly came from a team with clinical trial experience.

\N	\N	25,000,000	Yes.    The investigator is taking an extremely collaborative approach to the design and plans for implementation of this Phase 2 trial and intends to reach out to the CTSA Hubs, with particular focus on sites which have a track record in emergency care trials.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2020-02-15 00:00:00	2	\N	\N	2020-05-15 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	•\tAn operational hypothesis which can be examined in this study is ""Do estimated recruitment projections of participants with STEMI, obtained via ECG-based cohort discovery, reflect the actual enrollment numbers at the same study sites?"  •\tThis trial would offer a platform to test this hypothesis and demonstrate innovations in device-based cohort discovery methods. We will demonstrate the emergency medicine IT infrastructure that the JHU-Tufts TIC is developing in collaboration with the RIC for use in cohort discovery, and real-time enrollment and monitoring.  •\tThe Trial Innovation Network has the opportunity to support this innovative study design which requires careful and collaborative planning and protocol development involving a multi-disciplinary team of EMT personnel, emergency medicine physicians, cardiologists, data collection experts.  •\tThis study would allow true collaboration between the Trial Innovation Network and SIREN Network at both leadership level and study site level. The study provides an opportunity for the Trial Innovation Network to collaborate with the SIREN Network and leverage both networks shared resources to develop and disseminate best practices and innovations in the design and execution of, and recruitment for emergency medicine trials.  •\tThis study provides unique opportunities for the RIC (in collaboration with all stakeholders) to develop novel engagement strategies for emergency medicine studies to address the specific recruitment challenges faced in this area.  •\tThe RIC will also advise on the coordination and training of multidisciplinary teams at each site to achieve recruitment and protocol implementation goals.  •\tThis comprehensive consult will explore the possibility of using EFIC in the Central IRB context, which has not previously been done.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Following a 60 minute webinar with the principal investigator and his team to discuss the protocol design and statistical analysis, we have the below observations and comments:   Recommendations:   •\tFor the primary endpoint, all TIMI blood flow grades (not just TIMI 3) should be included in the analysis to show if successful reperfusion was achieved in all participants.  •\tSecondary endpoints should be straightforward and clearly address the study hypothesis that RUC-4 will improve pre-PCI blood flow and reduce infarct size. Any additional measurements of interest can be collected (if not overly burdensome or complicated) and analyzed as exploratory endpoints.  •\tThe inclusion of four treatment arms should be reviewed from a feasibility perspective.  •\tInfarct size measured via MRI at 30 days may be an easier endpoint to assess than ejection fraction  •\tThe Phase 2 should be a short study with short term follow up.  •\tAn angiogram core lab and MRI core lab should be used.  •\tA comprehensive data and safety monitoring plan is required.  •\tThe hypothesis and design of the future Phase 3 study should be kept in mind when designing the Phase 2 study, as the Phase 2 results can and should inform the Phase 3 design. For example, individual endpoints in this Phase 2 study may be components of a composite Finkelstein-Schoenfeld endpoint for the future Phase 3 study.  •\tPatient Reported Outcome measures around pain relief, injection site and QOL/Self-assessment were agreed as reasonable measurements. These should be kept as simple as possible and can provide preliminary data to inform the selection of more in-depth PRO measures for the Phase 3 study. Some favored questionnaires are the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (preferred over the Seattle) and the Minnesota Questionnaire. The PROMIS may not be very widely used. MAPIgroup.com is a useful repository of PRO Measures.  •\tThe generalizability and ability to compare PRO's across groups and the presence of comorbidities should be considered. The precision of the measurement has to be suitable to be able to assess the expected effect. The investigator should review each question within a questionnaire to assess what relevant data required by clinicians and other stakeholders will be collected.  •\tIn the event that private funding is secured for the entire Phase 2 trial, we recommend that this study undergoes peer-review.    The JHU-Tufts TIC supports a Comprehensive Consultation to work with the investigator to develop the study protocol, specifically the selection of the endpoints, development of the statistical analysis plan and a comprehensive data and safety monitoring plan.     Other Comments:   •\tIf successful, this trial could lead to a change in clinical practice by demonstrating improved outcomes as a result of immediate EMS administration of anti-platelet agents.  •\tThere was no statistical analysis plan available as the endpoints have not been finalized. This will be developed with the investigator if a comprehensive consultation is approved.  •\tThe investigator has consulted with numerous expert clinicians and biostatisticians from within his institution and across the CTSA network on the study design.  •\tThe investigator continues to engage with FDA and NHLBI in the development of the RUC-4 clinical. The FDA approved in general the clinical plans for RUC-4 development at a pre-IND meeting in July 2016.	\N	\N	t	2017-01-31 00:00:00	t	\N	\N	2	This is Phase 2 study which aims to enroll 300 participants, and therefore should be within the capacity of the Trial Innovation Network.

The JHU-Tufts TIC has the capacity and expertise to provide comprehensive consultation to develop the proposal, and to offer DCC and CCC services once the study is ready to begin in late 2018. The investigator has requested to work specifically with the JHU-Tufts TIC for both comprehensive consult and study implementation if approved. The Tufts PI, Dr Selker, is experienced in running large, emergency cardiology trials and can provide expertise and lessons learnt from previous emergency cardiology trials during the comprehensive consultation as well as advising on innovative approaches to clinical decision making and enrollment monitoring. The JHU team at BIOS is also experienced in designing and executing international multi-site trials in emergency stroke trials.

Challenges include:   •\tThe restrictive time window (< 4 hrs. from symptoms/EKG confirmation), which is required to assess the effectiveness of this product for future use.  •\tThe patient's inability to consent due to pain, cardiac compromise. EMS/First Responders will primarily enroll patients.  •\tCoordination of enrollment and protocol implementation across multiple services and multiple sites in different geographic areas. Previous studies of this nature noted in the application were done in limited geographical areas. Expansion of this could present issues with multiple stakeholders' commitment level and the sheer burden of coordination.    Recommendations for trial include:   •\tExtensive feasibility assessment to identify qualified, dedicated sites which have extensive experience in emergency medicine trials, to decrease likelihood of inappropriate patient enrollment and protocol violations.  •\tUtilization of Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) to increase likelihood of achieving recruitment goals. The investigator should discuss this possibility with FDA in the near future.  •\tIf EFIC were not utilized, we would recommend a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of informed consent of this population at up to 3 selected sites.  •\tFocused studios with representative members of EMS, ER, PCI Team at each site to develop a recruitment and protocol implementation to address each sites unique challenges and align the standard of care at each site with the protocol. We recommend utilizing the CTSA Hub Liaisons at the CTSA sites to help facilitate the coordination of the studios.  •\tPossible development of a phone based application that EMS can use to alert the Study Team when a potential patient is in route to help facilitate enrollment and protocol implementation.  •\tRoutine scheduled meetings with representatives of the involved ancillary services by the PI at each site to review enrollment cases and trouble shoot any issues identified during ongoing enrollment in the trial.  •\tReview of enrollment and protocol guidelines by a central source within 1 week after enrollment to evaluate a preset level of acceptable protocol compliance to study procedures and enrollment time window. Results of these reviews can be used as a guideline to refine any enrollment and protocol procedures as needed and provide further protocol training as necessary.	\N	\N	\N	482	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-06-08 00:00:00	\N	Paul Harris	\N	t	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	Tiina Urv	2019-02-15 00:00:00	t	\N	2018-01-26 00:00:00	\N	2020-02-15 00:00:00	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	2019-11-15 00:00:00	f	\N	\N	2019-02-15 00:00:00	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2	28	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	t	\N	2	2018-05-15 00:00:00	Overall Budget (includes site budget and recruitment budget)     The overall budget to support both Phase 2 studies (Phase 2A and Phase 2B) is expected to be $25 million which seems reasonable for two small-medium sized studies.

This study is a VA study with only 2 of the non VA sites being CTSA sites.  This assessment led to concerns as to whether this trial would actually benefit from cIRB with the current inability of VA to rely on TIN.  Following this discussion it was determined by the JHU TIC cIRB managers that it was not in the TIN nor the PI's best interest to utilize the TIN for cIRB services.  Dr. Hanley and Cindy MacInnis communicated this verbally to Dr. Spain who was accepting of this decision and a formal e-mail was sent informing Dr. Spain of the decision thereafter on October 4th.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	205	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	[]	[]	[]

It is best to send it only to the HLT POC.    Instead of receiving feedback in all different ways, consider including a link to a survey (REDCap or Qualtrics) to ask for specific feedback.  This will help in the end to pull all of the responses together is the same manner.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	51	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	12-Feb-2018:  Due to delay in biologics at UCB and Janssen.

Yes/No; Please provide a brief explanation. Yes; there is nothing outside the Network's current resources. This is a request for discrete services.  o If the study is too large or complex, could we offer discrete (Standard) services instead  o If we offer discrete services how would they be paid for? TBD by JHU/Tufts TIC. The LOS implies that the services will be provided as in-kind services and there will be no cost to the Investigator, excerpt from the LOS: "The Trial Innovation Network will provide central IRB and standard agreement services for the project."	\N	\N	451	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	Comprehensive Consultation/Implementation	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	2017-03-09 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	485	Davis	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-06-12 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-03-20 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Ethics discussions with Dr. Jeff Botkin, Co-Investigator at the University of Utah and medical ethicist, regarding WGS and recruitment.  Dr. Botkin's recommendation was to consider looking at only actionable genes in the neonatal period, immediately treatable or treatable  within the first 1-2 years of life. He recommended not disclosing other findings to parents. Dr. Botkin corresponded directly with Dr.  Davis agreeing that setting up a clean comparison of the intervention with the control is the key study design issue. Ascertainment bias  would be present if the intervention is tested but the control group is not tested. This is a problem in newborn screening where typical  comparisons are between a screened group and a clinical diagnosis group. In that context, the problem is that the screened group is  enriched with infants with mild or subclinical forms of the disease, where the clinical group is infants who are sick enough to prompt  testing. When the comparison of outcomes is done, the screened group tends to look better, but perhaps only because the screened  group is enriched with less severely affected infants. A false conclusion can be drawn about the clinical utility of screening. In Dr.  Davis' project, the bias could go the other way. What if the inclusion criteria for screening are sicker than those in the control group?  Dr. Botkin referred Dr. Davis to the Wisconsin cystic fibrosis study begun in the 1980s, PI Mike Farrell.  If approved for implementation, Dr. Davis expressed an interest in a recruitment plan with strict timelines, and specific advice on WGS  consenting. Investigator did not think a RIC consult would be necessary but left that determination to the network.	\N	453	\N	1030	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	55	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	Paul Harris	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Tiina Urv	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	72	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	t	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	2016-12-13 16:23:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Yes, if funded the budget is feasible for the revised project as described.

Additional development discussions surrounding the following operational hypotheses will be needed to determine an area of focus.    1)\tThe use of FaceTime or Skype to consent.  Given the site dynamics of the trial, the resources most familiar with the trial may not be on location when the fractures are identified.  To combat this problem the team would like to use a remote consenting strategy. We anticipate this to increase the rate of enrollment capture for sites that choose to employ this method.  2)\tThe project plan is to run 2 trials parallel under the assumption of efficiency given the site overlap and similarity in treatment.  We will work with the investigator to measure efficiency against similar projects.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Given the stage of the proposed project, no working protocol was available for review. We did review the general design of the proposed studies. A concern about the scarcity of data to support the non-inferiority design was raised as a consideration.  Recommended the team consider moving to a superiority design or a way to estimate clinical meaningful difference.	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	Yes. TIN capacity was not a concern for this trial.  A transition plan will be beneficial to consider as the project is developed as these trials are intended to be the beginning of a number of studies that answer a specific questions for the IMPACCT group.  Under the current plan for the U01, the project will be going into its last year as the current TIN funding period comes to an end.  Lessons learned and efficiencies will need to continue on to future projects that have the potential to outlive the TIN.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	66	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-07-02 00:00:00	IMPACCT	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	2025-05-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mary Stroud	\N	\N	502	$0	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	No major recommended changes with the R34 budget.  The submitting investigator adequately accounted for the planning activities including preparation for site activation at the very start of the U01 funding.  Some further evaluation and discussion about the coordinating center staff responsibilities in managing the Central IRB process for sites is needed as part of the comprehensive consultation.  High level discussions about these responsibilities did take place, but translation to budget is still needed.  U01 budget does not currently exist, but will be developed as part of the R34 planning grant.	f	\N	\N	482	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-03-23 00:00:00	$426,948	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	IMPACCT: Infrastructure for musculoskeletal pediatric acute care clinical trials	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	Initial Consult: Projected Timelines, Recruitment and Retention, Assessment of Study Feasibility	2024-06-30 00:00:00	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	2025-05-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2019-07-31 00:00:00	Yes.

The study team's goal to increase the number of sites to 25-30 presents an opportunity for CTSA institutions to identify investigators at their institutions for participation in the study.	2018-05-01 00:00:00	\N	40	\N	t	\N	\N	2022-10-31 00:00:00	2	\N	\N	2023-07-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	26	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The need for an operational hypothesis was reviewed with the investigator and a number of initial ideas were discussed.  Additional discussions surrounding the following operational hypotheses will be needed to determine an area of focus.    1)\tWith identification of rhythm abnormalities coming from expectant mothers at home, an application/tool for feedback to the site physicians and documentation of this communication would be clinically useful. The Duke/Vanderbilt TIC has experience in this area of patient reported outcomes and can assist in implementing such a tool.  We anticipate a tool of this nature will lead to more efficient and accurate reporting of abnormalities leading to earlier diagnosis confirmation and treatment.   2)\tGiven the use of Doppler and Echocardiogram to discover abnormalities and confirm diagnosis, this trial presents an opportunity to improve technical measurements within the study, including inter-rater reliability, acquisition cost, data quality, and results reproducibility.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Working protocol is currently in the early stages of development and was not supplied during the consultation, though we did review aims and statistical considerations.  Our TIC statistical lead expressed concern with the derivation of the historical control rate and its variability. After additional background information was supplied, we suggested a re-assessment of power calculations to connect the design to the historical literature.	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	Yes. TIC and RIC capacity is not a concern.  The study is ideal for TIN goals in its sample size and number of sites.  It will provide an opportunity for the TIN to be involved in the majority of trial operational components, allowing for potential testable hypotheses related to data harmonization, data collection tools, site start-up, ongoing site management and assurance of data quality.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2019-04-01 00:00:00	72	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-10-01 00:00:00	STOP BLOQ	\N	2019-05-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	1	2023-12-01 00:00:00	\N	>$500k per year	\N	\N	Mary Stroud	All dates are estimated	>$500k per year	469	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Investigator targeted a budget under $500K cap with little detail supplied to this point.

We recommended further re-evaluation and detailed assistance during a comprehensive consultation.  We also recommended the investigator consider extending the grant period to 6 or 7 years to accommodate enrollment as allowable under the UG3/UH3 mechanism.	t	\N	\N	482	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-02-20 00:00:00	$2,499,999 or $499,999/yr over 5 years	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Surveillance and Treatment to Prevent CAVB Likely to Occur Quickly	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	Operationalize Standard Agreements  Operationalize cIRB  Recruitment plan  Recruitment materials  Other	2025-06-30 00:00:00	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	2026-06-30 00:00:00	\N	\N	t	\N	help finding  a DCC and getting a quote	\N	\N	2023-12-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	5	[document]	2019-01-01 00:00:00	Yes.

Study Design: Participants will be evaluated up to 14 days prior to randomization and will also be asked to keep a diary  to document Raynaud attacks for 1 week. Participants will be randomized to receive study drug, BH4, or placebo and be  given study drug to take home with them for self-administration. At each study visit, patient reported outcomes will be  collected. Wound care will also be done simultaneously at local wound care clinics.    After discussions of the study design and study aims, the Utah TIC made the following recommendations:  1. Refine definition for net digital ulcer burden and ulcer assessments  2. Request assistance from CCTS for Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD) and wound care  3. Provide amniotic membrane to participating sites in order to standardize wound care treatment  4. Send survey to participants to record their outcomes more regularly  5. Stratify the participant population by climate  6. Make sure the microvascular definition is functional  7. Recommend using a powder form of the study drug  8. Conduct a single site pilot first, then a multi-site study in two years    Current Database Information: Dr. Frech currently maintains a local Scleroderma registry. She would like to  enhance the registry with images of the progression and/or healing of digital ulcers as well as the patient reported  outcomes from the study. After discussions of how best to integrate the improvement of the existing database into  this study, the Utah TIC made the following recommendations:  1. Export the design of the REDCap database  2. Find and utilize a smartphone application to take photos of participants' wounds weekly    Budget and Feasibility: Dr. Frech would like to enroll 30 participants over 6 sites. The budget and feasibility  challenges currently focus around obtaining and shipping drug to all participating sites. After discussions, the Utah  TIC made the following recommendations:  1. Ensure that the pharmacy used for the study drug can ship to all study sites  2. Include the amniotic membrane into the budget so that treatment can be standardized to all sites  3. Have the drug shipped as a powder and the patient will reconstitute it themselves  4. Have the participant ship the study drug box with empty vials back to PI. This will ensure accurate drug  accountability    Regulatory and IND: Dr. Frech requested advice on submitting an IND for her study drug, BH4. The Utah TIC made  the following recommendations:  1. Create a pre-IND application prior to submitting the IND for the study drug. This will allow the FDA to review the  IND information and give feedback and advice prior to submission.  2. Do not include the vitamin powder on the IND application for study drug  3. Obtain a letter from the study drug sponsor, giving their authorization to cross-reference their drug IND  information  4.

TIN decision letter pending.     07-Oct-17  Kick-off meeting is scheduled for 10/9/17 from 7-9 AM PT. Dr. Simpson has provided slides and the requested IRB-related information we will need for the CIRB portion of the consult.    01-SEP-17  Had initial phone call with investigator today. Reviewed current status and top priorities for CIRB and standard agreements.  Next steps: Type up summary of initial phone call and send to internal team. Schedule meeting with internal team to prep for webinar. Schedule 1-3 hour webinar with Dr. Simpson to discuss our advice and guidance.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	198	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	[]	[]	[]

TIC recommends either a reduction in site burden and thus a refinement of design or an increase to total budget that would require going over the $500K per year cap to accomplish study goals.  The investigator indicated understanding and willingness to make adjustments of this nature.	Yes, the study design appears feasible to implement.  I agree with this TIC that budget changes are needed.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	yes	\N	\N	t	The need for an operational hypothesis was reviewed with the investigator.  A hypothesis will be finalized as part of the comprehensive consultation.  Potential opportunities for operational innovation for which operational hypotheses could be designed include.   •\tAdoption of data standards to promote efficiency of AE/SAE reporting  •\tData Driven Trial Management/Risk Based Monitoring approach to clinical monitoring.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Working protocol was supplied by the investigator and only minor updates occurred during the initial consultation.  TIC expressed concern with the large workload for sites and the potential quality problems that could occur as a result.  Current design causes a budget feasibility issue as the majority of funds under the $500K cap are devoted to paying sites for large workload.  Only minor concern with language describing composite endpoint.     Review from NICHD study section highlighted several issues with the submitted grant, including lack of innovation. At follow-up meeting 11-May-2018, TIC recommended change in focus of the project to achieve   a budget of <$500K per year, while still achieving clinically meaningful results. An additional strategy that could be considered is to increase budget to >$500K per year to support current scope, with notable change in study design to meet requirements for innovation. Preference from the TIC is for the former option given the low likelihood of award from NICHD for a budget >$500K per year.	t	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	Yes.

Only minimal effort for a statistician (5%) and data programmer (5%) was identified as inadequate to support DCC activities across the life of the trial. Additional recommendations included:    o\tPlan and budget for handling and reporting SAE's may need more development. Could be handled with paper and managed by process due to low event expectation, but IRB and FDA may dictate preference to some degree.   o\tHosting fee for a CDM platform other than REDCap would be significant.  Likely $25K - $30K per year based on previous experience at the TIC.  o\tDSMB reporting every 6 months combined with an IND study adds complexity and will increase the budget needed to support statistics.  o\tWill likely need a risk based approach to clinical monitoring of sites to reduce on site monitoring and focus on key risk indicators.  This is likely to increase DCC budget to support but will make the clinical monitoring budget more manageable.  o\tSimilar size and phase studies with modest sized CRF's have budgeted $120k - $150K for DCC activities.	t	\N	\N	482	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-11-07 00:00:00	$1,265,625.  paid to 6 sites over 48 months.

This helps with eliminating the 20% of patients who immediately will stop taking the drug due to side effects. The placebo group with apparent side effects drops out here too. By losing this 20% early on, you decrease the costs to this group  \t\t\t · Then the 118 subjects per site enrollment starts at month one.   \t\t\t·  Design an incentive program for this remaining group  \t\t\t·  For those remaining from Day 31 to end of the study should be considered healthy and free of age-related comorbidities, since the exclusion criteria screens out other comorbidities.  Another suggestion:  ○ A run-in would make sense with a low dose betablocker for everyone to see who could tolerate drug prior to randomization.                           · Consider 25mg run-in prior to randomization to test tolerance and then start 50 mg at randomization or move to placebo arm;                            · Contact with patient after 30 days will be a safety measure (check BP) and a retention measure (ensure they haven't lost interest).    ○ ITT vs. mITT (modified intention to treat)                         · ITT assign those randomized to the beta blocker, then if they drop out, then assign them to the expected change. You wouldn't remove that bias so much and then do an on-treatment analysis secondarily.                          · mITT assign to randomized only those patients who remain on beta blocker after the 30 day run-in. This is more efficient with trial resources and will allow for better estimate of the possible treatment effect size.   ○ Let people know their eligibility baseline tests are in the "eligible" range, but be cautious about giving out baseline information related to the outcomes to the study participants.   ○ Inclusion/Exclusion:        · Consider adding orthostatic blood pressures;          · Consider limits on the range for higher end of SBP at baseline as some will be in the placebo arm and consider the lower range  of 120 SPB as the lowest possible allowable range.         · Consider an EKG at baseline for inclusion/exclusion screening; Define what EKG results will result in exclusion.          ·Consider adding EKG "for cause" on ongoing basis.   ○ Confirm with NIA about their policy on independent DSMB	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Beta1-blockade for bone loss	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mary Stroud	\N	\N	483	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	· PI budget aim is to be under $1.5 million/year indirects  · Suggest talking with NIA PO about the possibility of going to closer to $2 million/year.  \t\t○ Patients will be paid $200/visit (taking a pill daily, several assessments, big commitment over 2 years).

Low incidence of the disease in African-American women.   Make a cogent argument that you are doing the right size study for the population at risk.   Exploratory analysis on the drug that will help define a larger future study.   Aim for 25% minority population recruitment and then do stratified randomization which will support exploratory analysis on the sub-groups (racial/ethnic).  Leverage local resources such as Mayo's Community Engagement Research Core. They have been trained in conducting community engagement studios.

To date, our response rate is 67%. We will continue to work with the investigator on revising his LOI with a new target date of May 15th, 2018.    02-Jan-2018: We were previously preparing for a February 13th submission, NHLBI did not give the Investigator the green light to submit with this cycle, new target date October 11th, 2018.   06-Nov-2017: A kick-off meeting was held on October 18th. Since then, the TIC and RIC have been working together to provide the PI with a computable phenotype to identify eligible patients in EMRs.  This Phenotype then was then ran at Vanderbilt, JHU, Utah, and Ohio. The TIC also worked on assisting the Investigator with revising his current budget to reflect his sample size and site number increase.  A site analysis for CINEMA and a similar trial, ISCHEMIA, was carried out to strengthen Investigator's letter of intend submitted October 27th.    09-Oct-2017: The TIC has already contacted the Investigator.

If still open, could send a newsletter updating publications findings  from original study with a story discussing that they are planning a follow up study and interested individuals could  contact the study site.  • The study team will need to determine the re-contact permission status of participants at the end of the original study.  • For those participants who gave re-contact permission consider sending invitational letter via USPS or email (if  available) describing study extension plan to determine interest in participation. Would be good to re-emphasize (in lay  language) societal benefits from their previous participation. Include consent form and recruitment site contact  information. Telephone follow-up if no response with 2 weeks. Might also reach out to proxy if they no response to first  letters.  • Domestic toll free number would be low cost and allow easy participant access for questions.  • For those participants without re-contact permission recommend contacting their primary care physician to introduce  the HALT study extension. Include a written study summary, NEJM article from original study, with option to provide  study details presentation to clinical team.  • Utilize EHR to identify upcoming clinic visits for participants who are being followed by local recruitment sites &   present study extension information in person.  • Consider utilizing clinical laboratory results if available to reduce study barriers.  • Would not recommend broad based recruitment advertising through advocacy groups since the population is predefined.  Study team time would be better spent reaching out to the participants directly and avoid receiving contacts  from participants who are not part of the original cohort so not eligible.  • There are concerns that as this cohort is moving forward toward disease progression it might introduce bias for those  who chose to join verses those who do not.    Retention Recommendations:  • In-person visits are planned for 0, 24, and 48 months. For those participants not routinely followed at one of the study  sites (moved, immobility, etc.) might consider utilizing distance based data/specimen collection to reduce study burden.  Options include home visit nurses or nation-wide drug store with nurse practitioners, local labs for blood draw.  Recommend contacting Examination Management Services, Inc. (EMSI) based on experience utilizing them as a  nationwide provider of medical services. Stressed importance of protocol training for all support service groups.  • We would recommend participant incentive for any study visits requiring travel and/or specimen collection. Would  want to have one compensation rate across all sites. Recommend rate of $20/hr. Subjects could opt out of  compensation.  • Consider decreasing the number of calls from every three months to every 6 months to reduce study burden.    Recommendations for proposal moving forward:  The HALT Study A Cohort team will be working closely with the CRISP team (Dr. Alan Yu) to model their data collection  tools and processes to facilitate data sharing. They will be working closely with Dr. Abebe at the University of Pittsburgh  DCC.  The ideas generated in the consultation session seem reasonable and helpful for the study team at this stage of project  planning.  Given the review and recommendations, it would seem the study team should have adequate resources and expertise  to follow-up without additional investment by the RIC.  We would be available for brief discussions if they have questions moving forward.    RIC Feasibility Assessment  The HALT A Study has a finite population as they are recruiting subjects who participated in their previous HALT PKD  Study. We believe it will be challenging to recruit all of the previous participants. Factors that may play a role in  recruitment efforts include; relocated without forwarding information, travel issues, worsening health, mortality.  There are concerns that as this cohort is moving forward toward disease progression it might introduce bias for those  who chose to join verses those who do not.	\N	\N	\N	1030	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	55	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Stephanie Mayers	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Tiina Urv	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2019-06-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	47	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	2016-12-13 15:03:00	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	The budget is feasible.	\N	[document]	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	0	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	[new_service_selection___7,new_service_selection___5,new_service_selection___4,new_service_selection___1,new_service_selection___2]	[]	[consult_options___4,consult_options___2]

I think the project has potential for success and appreciate the team's energy and focus to help an underserved community.  That said, it's  an atypical study for the TIN.  As the initially assigned PI for this submission, I spoke with the study team and confirmed that they were really only looking for an initial consultation from one of the TICS - specifically around topics of registry best-practices / tools + regulatory concerns related to cross-institution data hosting/sharing.  Given the writeup here from the Duke TIC, it sounds as though the consultation provided exactly what the study team was requesting.	\N	2017-08-28 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	t	t	\N	\N	0	t	This assessment was not part of the request from the PI.	t	\N	\N	2017-08-21 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	Not assessed as submitting investigator is not seeking comprehensive consult	\N	\N	The potential for success was not assessed during the initial consultation because the study team requested specific limited consultation in setting up a patient registry.	\N	No additional comment	482	t	\N	t	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	40	\N	f	not assessed	\N	t	\N	\N	Not assessed submitting investigator is not seeking comprehensive consult	Not assessed as not recommended by RIC	2	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Paul Harris	\N	f	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Guadalupe Aquino	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	f	The feasibility was not assessed during the initial consultation because the study team requested specific limited services outside the purview of the TIN (a patient registry).	\N	\N	94	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	f	\N	f	\N	f	\N	2	\N	\N	t	\N	t	This proposal requested specific limited services of assistance in developing a patient registry.

Two of the pathways were physician engagement and self-referral.  The project needs a clear engagement and recruitment plan for providers and patients.  The PI should also consider how he will encourage enrollment among underrepresented minority groups. This will be important for recruitment and retention efforts.  The RIC will provide ongoing support to identify and recruit registry participants including EHR recruitment optimization.     Priority #2: Retention and Return of Value  The PI should consider return of value propositions to encourage patients/participants to stay in the registry.  The RIC will provide ongoing guidance to the project to assist in creating a robust retention plan for registry participants.     Recommendations:  * Provide EHR recruitment optimization process and MyChart workflows used to identify patients with atypical diabetes.    * Share lessons learned from the community engagement sessions conducted during the planning phase of All of Us program (precision medicine initiative). This information may inform future recruitment strategies of underrepresented populations.    * Provide  successful retention strategies and return of value propositions to retain populations in large registries, e.g. BioVU    * Illuminate existing pathways to access patients, e.g. CTSA Consortium and public private partnerships to increase the diversity of potential participants	\N	\N	The identified operational innovations by the TIC and RIC are aimed at increasing efficiency of CIRB.

I am interested to hear why the TIC increased the Subject/Site budget from $1506.88/treated subject to $2625.00.  Budget points to consider:  - Some labs will be SOC labs pulled from chart review  - Other labs have no need for immediate resulting so I wonder if they could be batched/run at a central lab for lower prices?  - 500 ml phlebotomies should take 5-20 minutes via a 16 g needle. That phlebotomy plus vital signs, weight and med reconciliation shouldn't really take the 1-2 hours per visit as stated in the protocol.  (Unless I am missing something.)  These are low-intensity, high-throughput outpatient visits.  If part of the budget was to include space/nursing/clinic time then I imagine that time estimate could be dropped.  The 'no phlebotomy' budget was listed originally at $663.04 so I am assuming the lion's share of the $1506 or $2625 line item is for those 1-3 phlebotomy visits over one year.	\N	NO issues	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	[document]	Yes.	\N	\N	\N	Yes, an operational hypothesis can be embedded into the design of the study.

In addition, the participant will need to have reliable transportation to the research center or donation center to meet study needs.  •\tCompensation is a good strategy   •\tCommunity engagement studios to explore approach to recruitment, to explore how people may feel about giving blood multiple times, to explore how to frame potential benefit.     Following a review of all relevant materials and the initial consultation, plus a follow-up call with Dr. Rhonda Kost, our key recommendations, advice and guidance to Drs. McClain and Buse and their study teams include the following:  •\tWe would encourage the study to explore:  o\tA more robust cohort identification search with study inclusion criteria to gain a better understanding of possible patient numbers at each respective facility  o\tModes of transportation for people that need assistance getting to the centers  o\tText reminders, letters, phone calls, etc. of appointment days/times   o\tProviding links to websites that promote healthy living  o\tProvide lab feedback to participants in the phlebotomy group so they can mark progress in an easy to understand and useful format  •\tSomething to consider further is extending the recruiting timeline to provide ample time to get the number of participants needed. It is best to reach recruitment goals early than to extend total study time due to lower than expected recruitment rates.  •\tWe would propose/recommend that the study team consider designing and implementing community forums or other mechanisms such as community engagement studios to explore people's attitudes about:  o\tblood donation for research purposes  o\thow to frame the phlebotomy as the potentially beneficial intervention  o\tapproaching/enrolling minorities and under-served populations.  o\tA useful guide to planning and implementing studios can be accessed here:   https://victr.vanderbilt.edu/pub/resources/upload/files/CES%20Toolkit.pdf	This study is seeking private funding therefore it was not assessed for potential competitiveness in peer review, however it is unclear if the funding has been secured. RIC recommendation to compensate participants for phlebotomy sessions would need to be added to the overall budget in addition to funding for TIN implementation. This is something to consider. TIC/RIC comments indicate this study could be completed successfully if implemented by the TIN. It appears from the TIC comments that the investigative team is willing to make changes to study and collaborate with TIN to align to be within the TIN mission and CTSA Program.	\N	Initial consult suggests the operational innovation is online consent and text messaging for recruitment.  Consider how those operational innovations will be tested and measured.   This is an opportunity to explore some characteristics of online consenting:  populations for whom it works/doesn't work, methods of online consent, methods for texting, platforms for online consent and texting, etc.   I suggest that Network operational innovations be considered and developed as the study is being developed.	482	\N	1	f	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	Yes	7	\N	\N	Study design = see above  Budget = PI's willing to find additional funding to work  with the budget the TIC provided.	\N	\N	\N	\N	1.

Enrollment logs reviewed to determine why subjects are being excluded.  Initial Consultation held 12/6/2015 with the following priorities identified: Increase enrollment to meet Grant deadline.  Recommendations:  RIC to review enrollment logs to determine rational for exclusion. Re evaluate enrollment logs every 3 months.  RIC to assist with standardizing enrollment log across sites to better track rationale for eligibility.  PI to re instruct other site PIs regarding inclusion/ exclusion criteria.  RIC to search for additional tools to aid with on boarding and patient instructions.  PI to demonstrate devices to show patients during the consenting process so patients will be able to see the device and make a truly informed decision about participation.

The original budget submitted was $1.9M and the project was only awarded $950K.  Of the $950K, only $100K has been earmarked for coordinating center activities, which appears to be inadequate given the study parameters. Study team is preparing to ask for budgets from 3 centers for coordinating center responsibilities.  Potential centers include Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital in Hackensack,NJ, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and Duke Clinical Research Institute.  Bids are expected in February and could influence next steps for funding.

Submitting provider rationale and protocol consideration CIRB team will follow-up with CIRB committee member at Vanderbilt to assess appropriateness of the wavier of consent request in this scenario.  Submitting investigator indicated very little progress on redesign of protocol to a feasibility study.  We offered TIC review/input on changes as he continues to develop feasibility.

As the primary endpoint centers on adverse events, the team discussed the possibility of identifying events of interest for this patient population, and confirmed that a DSMB would be utilized to monitor safety. Key concerns, for which the investigator is requesting input are 1) the low frequency of the disease (especially BPD that develops pulmonary hypotension) and 2) equipoise to placebo. There is little to no data currently that supports off-label use of sildenafil in this patient population, and sites that offer sildenafil as standard of care for BPD would likely need to be excluded from participation. Because of the low frequency of BPD in premature neonates, the team is planning to recruit up to 30 enrolling sites to enroll the target 120 patients over 2 years. With such a low patient/site recruitment rate (<4 patients/site at most sites), the need to control for background therapy issues was discussed. The investigator is seeking input on trial design, analysis plans, and recruitment strategies to maximize enrollment and study outcomes.	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	Yes.

Recruitment consultation will be obtained from the RIC if appropriate, but the RIC initial consultation suggests this is unlikely to be needed.  This trial will use a relatively large number of sites, most of which are affiliated with CTSA Hubs, and this will provide an opportunity for Hub Liaison teams to provide assistance with community engagement in the context of EFIC.  The Hub Liaison teams may also provide assistance with risk based site monitoring.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	2023-10-01 00:00:00	See below	\N	\N	Duration of support surpasses the duration of current network funding.

Several have been highlighted in the text of this report.  Operational questions about single IRB and the interaction with EFIC will provide adequate experience to write academic manuscripts.  For example, will involvement of CTSA Hub Liaison teams simplify the community consultation component of EFIC?  Is it possible to do a global disclosure instead of each site defining its own disclosure procedures?	\N	\N	f	t	The PRoMPT BOLUS study is a pragmatic, two-arm, randomized controlled trial comparing fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (intervention arm) and normal saline (control arm) in children with septic shock.  The study will be conducted in two phases, a pilot to assess feasibility and the main study to compare effectiveness.  The main ("parent") study would include 18 sites within the PECARN network, 16 of which are CTSA sites, and will enroll 8,800 patients over 4 years. The pilot phase will focus on addressing the following study aims: (1) To demonstrate separation in study fluids for pediatric septic shock patients randomized to normal saline or lactated Ringer's resuscitation using a pragmatic study design, (2) to determine the proportion of eligible pediatric patients enrolled into a pragmatic trial of fluid resuscitation, and (3) to demonstrate ethical, clinical, and parental acceptability of Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC).     Since this consultation, the investigators have obtained local funding and will begin the pilot study without extramural support, at a single institution.  This study is anticipated to be completed in several months.  This has been the main reason for the prolonged period between the initial consultation and the final recommendations for support from the Trial Innovation Network.      The aims of the parent trial are to (1) test the hypothesis that fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's will reduce hospital mortality by at least 1% compared to fluid resuscitation with normal saline in pediatric septic shock and (2) to monitor the safety of lactated Ringer's versus normal saline in routine clinical practice.    Please see Attachment 5 - Study Design, Parent Trial    Original Eligibility Criteria:  Inclusion:  1. Patients between the ages of 6 months and < 18 years old  2. Clinical concern for suspected septic shock     a. Order for parenteral antibiotics for suspected infection AND     b. Administration of at least 20 mL/kg IV/IO fluid resuscitation  3. Additional fluid deemed likely to be necessary to treat poor perfusion, defined as either hypotension for age or abnormal capillary refill (clinician judgement)    Exclusion:  1. Receipt of >40 mL/kg IV/IO fluid prior to randomization  2. Transfer from an outside facility where volume of crystalloid fluid administration cannot be determined (i.e., receipt of >40 mL/kg IV/IO fluid cannot be rejected)  3. Clinician judgement that it is not safe to administer either NS or LR (e.g., presence of severe hyperkalemia or intracranial hypertension)  4. Parents/guardians or subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, may be non-adherent with study schedules or procedures    Once enrolled, participants will be randomized to receive either 0.9% normal saline or lactated Ringer's.  All participants will receive fluid until 11:59 pm of the next calendar day and will be assessed at hospital discharge or at 90 days from study enrollment, whichever comes first.    PROTOCOL REFINEMENT:  Challenge: Perform screening, eligibility assessment, and enrollment without a study team.  Treating physicians would review the inclusion and exclusion criteria to assess and enroll participants    Discussion Summary: Study screening and enrollment are tasks typically performed by a research coordinator, or some other member of the study team.  The treating physician may assess the participant, but may then defer to the study team to ensure all eligibility criteria is met.  During the discussion, each inclusion and exclusion criteria was reviewed.    Recommendations:   1. Keep all inclusion and exclusion criteria to a minimum  2. Consider removing all exclusion criteria and/or switching them to inclusion criteria. By removing exclusions, the eligibility has become pragmatic:     a. Exclusion criteria #4 becomes an inclusion criteria: Receipt of < 40  mL/kg IV/ IO fluid prior to randomization     b. Exclusion criteria # 3 becomes an inclusion criteria: In the clinician's judgement, it is safe to administer NS or LR (no signs of hyperkalemia or increased ICP)    Innovation: Pragmatic eligibility criteria. Normally, all patients meeting inclusion criteria are entered into the study EDC, and exclusion criteria are recorded.  This facilitates later alterations of the exclusion criteria, but requires explicit data collection about each exclusion criterion.  Reduce number of criteria, but shift into inclusion criteria makes it unnecessary to have inclusion and exclusion data collection in the EDC.      Challenge: How should treatment allocation and randomizations be concealed?    Discussion Summary: The discussion centered on when participants should be randomized since the treating clinicians will not be blinded.  One idea is to randomize participants prior to enrollment.  For example, on odd days of the month, participants will be randomized to receive lactated ringers, which on even days, participants would receive normal saline.  Another idea was to randomize participants after enrollment.  To do this, a system must be in place that would allow fast & easy enrollment and randomization on the part of the physician.  Electronic systems involving particular website, access codes, and login IDs can be problematic and prolonged for a physician in the midst of caring for a trauma patient.  Therefore, a simple envelope system was proposed.  Envelopes containing randomization information would be created and numbered sequentially.  The envelopes would be available to the ED physicians. The enrolling physician would take an envelope and simply follow the instructions inside.  The act of opening the envelope would enroll the participant and the instructions would dictate which treatment arm.  A protocol violation would occur if the envelope was opened, but the instructions were not followed.  The data coordinating center would have the means to monitor and create the randomization envelopes.    Recommendations: It was recommended that the study use an envelope system as discussed to enroll and randomize the participants.  A physician would identify a potential participant, select the next envelope from a group of sequentially numbered envelopes, open the envelope (which would enroll the participant) and follow the instructions for the type of fluid to be administered.      Innovation:  Pragmatic randomization. While envelope randomization is clearly an old technology, and we almost always use more sophisticated systems, in a pragmatic trial of this type (with no research team involved during enrollment and randomization), reverting to this old technology results in a more efficient workflow.     Challenge: Outcome Selection    Discussion Summary: Large pragmatic trials require endpoints that are simple, unbiased, objective, and unambiguous.  Therefore, Dr. Weiss has selected mortality as the study's primary outcome.  After reviewing the reasons for selecting this outcome in further detail, the group was in agreement with Dr. Weiss.    Recommendation: Mortality should remain the primary outcome for the study    Challenge: Should the study population be enriched with a younger age population or cancer patients?  Discussion Summary: Bayesian-type monitoring of pre-specified subgroups may demonstrate a higher probability of differential outcome related to LR vs NS.    Recommendations: To not enrich the study population as this hinders generalizability and also the cancer patients may have documented limitations of support in place.	\N	\N	\N	2017-01-31 00:00:00	t	\N	study size and scope seems reasonable for the Network	\N	This is a study that we have the capacity and resources to support.

Since the initial consultation, it has been decided to execute the pilot study with local funding, so the NIH proposal will be submitted in February 2018. NICHD has indicated that it will not allow a submission greater than $500,000 direct expenses.  During the initial consultation, Utah TIC staff helped the investigators reduce their patient-related budget to meet this requirement.  The investigators have been able to construct a budget that will have low baseline support at each of 18 sites, and will provide capitation of $150 per patient.  This budget will be presented to the PECARN Steering Committee in September 2017 for approval, which is anticipated.      The Utah TIC would provide data management, data quality monitoring, statistical management, risk based site monitoring, trial training, site coordination, DSMB logistical support, central IRB, and coordination of EFIC efforts. This is anticipated to require a maximum of $300,000 direct expenses, which would come from the Utah TIC budget.	f	\N	t	482	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2016-12-05 00:00:00	$500,000/year for 5 years, totaling $2.5 million	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	2	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	1	\N	Pragmatic Pediatric Trial of Balanced versus Normal Saline Fluid in Sepsis (PRoMPT BOLUS)	\N	\N	\N	Yes - this would be a sizeable investment by the Utah team, but within scope.	2	\N	\N	Comprehensive Consultation and Potential Implementation	2023-10-01 00:00:00	2	\N	\N	453	\N	\N	2	\N	2024-03-01 00:00:00	t	Study is well within the scope of the Network	t	f	\N	\N	\N	2024-03-01 00:00:00	Michelle Culp	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	The Network can undertake this study at our current stage of development.

Discussion Summary: Jill Janssen director of Vanderbilt University Clinical Trials Center and part of the Recruitment Innovation Center (RIC) joined this discussion via phone.  Dr. Balamuth reviewed the current numbers of eligible patients within the PECARN network and nationally. Since the study will not be utilizing a dedicated study team, the clinicians will be the primary recruiters for the trial.  The investigators suggest using an electronic alert within the EHR when antibiotics and a bolus of fluid are ordered.  They also suggest having site monitoring audits to capture missed eligible patients.  Dr. Weiss would like to know if the RIC could be of assistance in adding to their recruitment plan.

Throughout the course of the consultation, it was advised to focus only on women with CP and SB, and narrow registry ambition only to 10,000 in this cohort and focus on the 1000 who will potentially become pregnant. Reduce the specific aims, by removing aim 2 and 5 as below:  Specific Aim 1: To develop on ongoing national prospective registry of reproductive age women (18-45) with physical and other disabilities.  Specific Aim 2: To quantify the pregnancy intentions and sexual and reproductive health behaviors and needs,  including contraception and STD prevention, of reproductive age women with physical and other disabilities.  Specific Aim 3: To determine the incidence and correlates of a) pregnancy and b) selected maternal and perinatal  outcomes in the cohort of reproductive age women with CP or SB.  Specific Aim 4: To describe women's perceived need for support systems and audit the adequacy of selected  clinician practices during pregnancy and postpartum in women with CP or SB.  Specific Aim 5: To archive maternal and newborn (cord) blood from a subset of women with CP and SB in a dedicated biorepository for future funded ancillary investigations of genetic and epigenetic factors that may mediate transmission and severity of CP and SB.    By reducing the spec aims, first establish a registry that will consists of Tier 1 data collection, with the general purpose of improving the health care for women of child bearing age who have SB or CP.  The registry would be described as focused on child bearing age, so it would include issues of pregnancy, but could also include other health care issues for this age group of women, and would be set up to permit participants to be approached for specific Tier 2 research projects.  For this proposal, the Tier 2 research project would simply be to find out if any of them become pregnant during longitudinal follow up.  Infrastructure will need to be set-up to make the registry robust, such as devising a newsletter strategy to maintain retention, and then potentially working with the CP and SB patient organizations to identify areas of patient centered concerns.  This could lead to potential PCORI applications in the future, that might deal with any aspect of disability in this population, even beyond reproduction.  However, for this project, there would be baseline phenotypic information about their disability, permission to contact them regularly to inquire about their health and pregnancy related questions, and a communication network to preserve participant retention.  The main outcome would be pregnancy counts and extremely limited description of those pregnancies.  (As soon as a couple thousand Tier 1 participants have been recruited and the pregnancy counts increase, then it is advised to submit the next grant in order to get delivery records to analyze details). The timeline would be, the first year to finalize the publicity materials and mechanisms and to start the recruitment process through the CTSA consortium.  Subsequent years would be focused on enrollment, with attention to whether certain populations were not being adequately enrolled, which could lead to RIC assistance for reaching specific racial or ethnic groups, etc.  It is advised to have a conservative enrollment goal. For example, target 2,000 enrollments per year (1,000 with each condition).  When progress is made on the base R01, then apply for additional grants built on the existing robust registry, and include the more detailed questions.	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	Yes, the Utah TIC has the capacity and resources to provide CIRB services for this registry.

The PI revised the budget between the two consultation meetings on the 11th and 16th by reducing the budget. The TIN may be able to provide CIRB support and referrals via CTSA sites for the trial, which will alleviate some funding issues. However, PI is strongly encouraged to seek additional co-funder and/ or remove some of the registry activities. Recruitment and marketing costs will be the biggest costs. The Utah TIC finance manager recommends increasing the recruitment and marketing budget. The Nurse Coordinator budget as it stands (.5 FTE) is very low for the participant population needs, reaching out and enrollment goal of the registry. Consider increasing Nurse Coordinator budget at each hub. Utah TIC PI advises study PI to go back to NICHD to include funding for a more robust DCC budget, including an MS Statistician. Ensure there is enough  money to get the registry started.	f	\N	\N	482	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-03-23 00:00:00	Approx $770,000 direct costs for consortium	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	National Prospective Multicenter Registry of Reproductive Age Women with Disabilities: Pregnancy in Cerebral Palsy and Spina Bifida	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	Initial Consult: Study Budget, Recruitment and Retention and Assessment of study feasibility	\N	2	\N	\N	453	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	2024-12-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	The TIN would be providing CIRB and RIC services only.	\N	\N	452	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	584	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	2019-04-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	2019-11-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-06-03 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	2	\N	\N	UAB's deadline for grant submission is by  5/29/18.	584	Tita	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-05-04 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-05-04 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Recruitment of women with two very specific disabilities may prove to be difficult. The study PI has determined that the National Perinatal Research Consortium plus UCLA will serve as regional hubs to assist in study coordination and recruitment, but not necessarily be the recruitment centers. Potential participants will self-register, or be registered by a legal representative, so local community PCPs, health clinics, therapy clinics, and assisted living facilities might all be targets for recruitment areas. There is some concern regarding a very tight budget, especially for coordinators (50% effort allocated) and study materials and advertisements.     Recommendations:  Reach out to Spina Bifida Association or Spina Bifida Association of America to gauge interest in participating in a similar manner as Cerebral Palsy Foundation, ie budget and effort assistance.

We found this approach to be challenging in that it may be too confounded with time and selection bias.  We suggested Aim 2 be addressed by selecting patients prospectively and matching them in some fashion. The investigator agreed in concept but continued refinement of Aim 2 will be needed to achieve a successful grant submission.  Aims 1 and 3 seem appropriate and achievable given the current parameters of the project.	t	\N	t	2017-08-25 00:00:00	t	\N	\N	1	Yes.

Due to the prevalence of SCD in African Americans, the study would benefit greatly from a community engagement studio as well as culturally-tailored recruitment materials. The cohort study is also potentially following the participants for up to 20 years, so retention will also be key. The RIC is proposing a MyCap application for participant engagement over the course of the study.

Request was for DSMB, a RAVE DB build, and a recruitment feasibility assessment.  Study is already funded and the submitting investigator has clearly stated his funding would not cover any TIN services.   Additional internal TIC meeting was held 5-Jan-2018 and a follow-up with the submitting investigator is scheduled for 5-Feb-2018.  Limitations with the submitting investigator's schedule prevented any earlier meeting.     31-Jan-2018 - Internal RIC meeting was held to assess recruitment feasibility. Based on this assessment  the RIC feels no immediate support is needed. The study team has an adequate budget for recruitment, sufficient patient population, and have addressed subject compensation and outlined how they will identify subjects in a timely manner for enrollment. The RIC would like to be available to The Golden Calf team if they encounter recruitment/retention obstacles during the study. As a reference for the study team, the RIC provided the link the Recruitment Innovation Center Recruitment Toolkit. -SN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	243	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	[]	[]	[]

This trial is likely to be successful in its application for funding, as this PI's qualifications and experience are appropriate. The Investigator has a strong research team and adequate time to provide oversight.     The proposal aligns with network mission/operational innovation, in particular its aim to utilize all 65 CTSA hubs for recruiting patients, which has not been done before. This provides an opportunity to test patient and provider engagement strategies around messaging and return of value propositions that could provide a framework for future CTSA studies.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	13-SEP-2017: The TIC and RIC have completed this Initial Consultation, the report was sent to the PI and all PAT required materials have been uploaded.   11-SEP-2017: RIC and TIC are working on the summary report and all other documents to be submitted to the PAT.   31-AUG-2017: RIC Consultation.

The study design is an open-label 3 arm design using a Bayesian Adaptive Design for randomization (N = 300). As mentioned previously this study aims to determine which of three treatments has the greatest effect on slowing disease progression in ALS. Secondary aims are to determine the tolerability of the drug therapies and their effect on respiratory decline in ALS, and rates of decline using a patient-derived functional rating scale. In order to support the clinical trial design the Investigator will leverage existing initiatives to streamline patient engagement, regulatory oversight, recruitment, outcomes data collection, and results dissemination across all participating sites. The Investigator plans to utilize 3 large existing networks to help recruit participants (CReATe, GPC, and UC BRAID) and the NCATS SMART IRB model for central IRB review. He plans to use EHR-defined computable phenotypes for patient screening (where available), and compare this approach to traditional recruitment strategies in the clinic or via patient advocacy groups. He also plans to engage patients to participate in trial design, study conduct parameters, and dissemination of study results. The investigator's second aim is to determine if two repurposed cardia drugs, mexiletine and ranolazine, both with similar neuronal mechanisms of action (preventing nerve hyperexcitability) will slow disease progression or improve symptoms compared to placebo (standard of care) using a novel Bayesian Adaptive Design. The primary outcome will be change in disease progression by monthly measures of ALSFRS-R from enrollment to 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes are change in disease progression by monthly measures of PADL-ALS, the Patient Activity of Daily Living scale, change in forced vital capacity (FVC), and change in ALS Quality of Life Scale. The Investigator specifically requests that the TIC assist him with defining his secondary outcome measures for Aim1. The proposed treatment arms were discussed, in particular with regard to the standard of care for ALS patients and how it affects the proposed design. All treatment arms include those patients who are taking Rilutek, but only 65% of ALS patients will actually be taking this particular drug. Patients who opt against taking Rilutek cannot be excluded. Standard ALS trials patients can change medications, but unfortunately the Investigator has no control over this and so the design must account for variability in standard of care, as well as possible confounding effects of riluzole.     Recommendations/suggestions:   �\tIt is advisable that the Investigator review the inclusion and exclusion criteria regarding safety. For example, exclusion of participants who have had a recent MI could be considered. Also the Investigator should consider adding more safety information for the patients.   �\tPerhaps establishing a baseline effect of riluzole could be added to the design.    Recommendations for comprehensive consult:  �\tDevelop/refine a safety monitoring plan   �\tDevelop ways to engage patients regarding safety issues and acceptability  �\tAssist in defining secondary outcome measures for Aim 1, assess opportunities for innovations in engagement, recruitment, and data collection  o\tEHR-based recruitment versus traditional recruitment  o\tDevelop ALS outcome template to move data directly from EHR into REDCap versus traditional entry into REDCap  o\tThe use of video sessions with participants for follow-up visits to enhance retention    Priority #2: Assessment of Statistical Analysis Plan  Summary of the discussion or discussion points:      It is recommended that the primary outcome of interest (ALS Functional Rating Score-Revised) be collected every month for each enrolled patient. Outcome data can be used to determine efficacy and futility at pre-specified time points. In contrast, it is recommended that no stopping rules be based on adverse events. The development of the interim analysis can be informed by longitudinal analyses of the de-identified PRO-ACT data (https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT). An adaptive Bayesian design was suggested whereby 26-week data can be used to predict 52-week outcomes, thus allowing the previous results to determine and inform adjustments to the trial design as the study progresses. An adaptive design, where assignment into each arm is informed by collected data, can shorten the development process without compromising the safety and efficacy. This may be beneficial with a rare disease like ALS since little success in treatment breakthroughs have been observed in previous ALS clinical trials.     Recommendations/suggestions:   �\tUse the PRO-ACT data to assess the relationship between 6 month data and 12 month data in the outcomes of interest.  �\tConsider using the 13-week data to predict the 52-week data instead of data at 26 weeks, as there should be predictive value in the earlier results as well.  �\tPerform sensitivity analyses, using linear mixed regression models that control for within-person time trends, to handle missing data.      Recommendations for comprehensive consult:  �\tThe TIC Biostatistics Core can assist in exploring study designs other than Adaptive Bayesian designs.    �\tStudies using survival as the endpoint can also be investigated to compare endpoint efficiency.    Priority #3: Data Management and Data Capture System  The data management plan was reviewed as part of the consult. Subjects will be recruited through a number of means: using EMR computable phenotypes to create a list of possible candidates at each site; one-on-one recruitment during individual clinic visits; using patient advocacy group (MDA, ALSA) newsletters, or clinic lists; and using the CReATE Connect ALS patient registry. The Investigator proposes two data management approaches: REDCap only versus EHR-i2b2 and REDCap. For the first option, patient study data will be captured and managed directly in REDCap, while with the second approach, the Investigator will leverage the availability of ALS clinic data in EHR-i2b2 which he plans to import into REDCap. The outcomes from the two different approaches will be collected to determine which approach best reduces the burden on patients, caregivers, and health care providers. The Investigator also plans to implement a patient visit and adverse event monitoring system via a two-way web-based video or via telephone to reduce the burden of participation and ensure retention.  It was discussed that RedCap has a DDP (Dynamic Data Pull) component that can pull data from an EMR to RedCap in real time.  However, there is resistance at many hospitals to allow RedCap to access EPIC data, especially when this involves multiple institutions. The Investigator has identified 39 possible sites of which only half have EHR/i2b2. Feasibility of integrating EHR and RedCap could add a significant burden and cost to the trial team. In addition, data in i2b2 are de-identified and not real-time, meaning it is unlikely to be useful for trial data collection (as opposed to cohort identification).  Recommendations/suggestions:   �\tIt is suggested that a more traditional approach is still needed for data collection; using direct EHR integration would be a sub-study (trial within a trial).  �\tIt is recommended to analyze existing data to determine screen yield and enrollment rate of the two approaches. Also, compare census data from the existing population database (regarding how much data was captured).  Recommendations for comprehensive consult:  �\tAssist with surveying of all proposed sites to determine/confirm EHR/i2b2 capability.  �\tCompare functional assessment from the two approaches (EHR or traditional) - including missing data points and timeliness to data entry.	\N	\N	t	2017-01-31 00:00:00	t	\N	I believe the Trial Innovation Network has the capacity and resources and JHU has the neuro expertise as well as operational expertise.	\N	This is a Phase II study which aims to enroll 300 participants, and therefore should be within the capacity of the Trial Innovation Network to support.

As this project is in its every early stages of development it is difficult to say if they will be successful or not.  It has a strong team and a valid hypothesis.

Community Engagement Studio to gain feedback on the overall study message to participants and to review the study website where participants are dropping off before enrolling. Feedback from the CES would also help shape the recruitment Plan and Materials.   2.) EHR Cohort to refine EHR criteria and the email invitation that is sent to potential participants.   3.) Recruitment Planning to review the current plan and materials and to provide advice and recommendations to improve recruitment.  4.) Recruitment Materials to provide support to existing materials or to help design new materials if the PI feels there is something the study is missing.	\N	f	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	Yes.

The team is very interested in making the study more pragmatic and have engaged in discussions independent of the Initial Consultation to enhance this part of their design.  They are very open to suggestions from the Trial Innovation Network.    Proposed Operational Hypothesis:     Evaluation of start-up times for sites in the US using the Trial Innovations Networks CIRB and Standard Agreements versus the start-up times in sites in Sweden.  Additional operational hypotheses will be evaluated as the comprehensive consultation process continues.	t	t	t	t	The SPIRIT study is being done as a follow-up study of TOPCAT.  TOPCAT was a global trial that had difficulty with enrollment.  They added a number of sites globally with potentially inconsistent training at the additional sites.  The data collected from the TOPCAT study had geographical differences within it  (e.g., add-on/concomitant  therapy and timing of standard of care visits showing regional differences).  A large portion of the goal of the SPIRIT study is to use the Sweden registry along with sites in the US to decrease the amount of the geographical variation, but still allow for the enrollment of the number of subjects that are needed.    The study proposes an enrollment strategy that includes the majority of sites (68) and patients (2400) located in Sweden to utilize the SwedeHF Registry.  U.S. based sites (52) are a much smaller component of the total number of patients (800).  This raises concerns over the generalizability of the results to the U.S. population. Recommend the use of PCORnet and/or EHR cohort discovery for evaluation of site population.      There was some discussion around the baseline characteristics of the study and the team noted that they were based on the data in Sweden.  Through the use of PCORNet and possibly the EHR-based cohort assessment (from the RIC), the teams can look at the patients in the US to see what the patients in the US would look like.  Additional follow-up occurred and the RIC is working on an assessment at the 5 pilot CTSA sites.      The study hypothesis identifies a 20% reduction in CV mortality and this may be more than needed to be clinically meaningful.  Recommended to the team that they re-evaluate this target and the associated power calculations.

Work with the Study Team to develop study specific recruitment plan which could include leveraging the EHR for potential screening of subjects with multiple modalities of contact (email, clinic, phone, mail).  Develop a REDCap survey as a prescreening tool when contacting subjects via email.   Develop strategies to help with subject retention and compliance (text messaging, reminder cards, birthday cards, etc.)	Strong team - scientific potential	\N	It appears the study has the potential to demonstrate an innovative operational approach.

The initial consultation was informative and we received positive feedback regarding several strategic ideas proposed during the call.  The consensus of the RIC team is that the study team has capacity to carry out the proposed strategies without further engagement from the RIC and that the RIC would not gain significant new experience in a deep service area at this point - so our recommendation is to provide summary advice to the study team and perhaps offer a 6-12 month follow-up review consultation, but not go forward with resource-intensive RIC services.	2	\N	\N	Recruitment Feasibility Assessment & Recruitment Materials	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	t	The applicant study team is seeking only limited recruitment services.	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	2017-02-01 00:00:00	No further services are being recommended for this trial.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	495	\N	t	t	t	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	2019-05-07 00:00:00	t	The study is feasible though it may take longer than project if retention issues emerge making it  challenging to complete.

This trial will be considered a success if  the risk based screening approach is found to be non-inferior to the annual screening approach in terms of safety and  superior to the annual screening approach in terms of morbidity. A study such as the WISDOM trial, regardless of the  outcome, has the power to advance the field and provide a framework to improve both breast cancer screening and  prevention in the future.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1/23/18 Introductory Call Completed between PI, study team and RIC POC's (Bethany & Mary).

One innovation that  was discussed during the consultation was to only enroll mothers to whom the screening tool would have  resulted in an early induction, and then to randomize these women to the two arms. This will greatly strengthen  the signal to noise ratio. Operational hypotheses would need to be developed as the proposal matures.	\N	t	t	t	Specific Aims, Protocol Development & Analysis: The OULI Trial proposal is a multi-center randomized  clinical trial to determine if the use of Active Management of Risk in Pregnancy at Term (AMOR-IPAT) will lead  to improved childbirth outcome as compared to more standard and less personalized approaches to term  pregnancy management. Dr. Nicholson's original proposal on February 10 included 4 arms: AMOR-IPAT  (experimental group), induction of labor (IOL) at 39 weeks, IOL at 40 weeks and IOL at 41 weeks. N = 1000. It  also included both nulliparous and multiparous women. When Dr. Nicholson presented on March 29th, he cut   one arm (IOL at 41 weeks) and limited recruitment to only multiparous women based on feedback he received  from the Utah TIC.  The primary endpoint of this study will be the modified Weighted Adverse Outcome Index Score (mWAOI  Score). The mWAOI Score is based on the published and validated 10-item Weighted Adverse Outcome Index  Score but has the addition of two other items: cesarean delivery and complicated NICU admission.  No formal power calculation was provided in the proposal to project the sample size. Dr. Nicholson anticipates  needing 1000 subjects, split evenly among each arm, to provided clinically statistical results.  Currently in the obstetrics field, IOL is not recommended prior to 39 weeks of age. AMOR-IPAT tool has the  potential to recommend IOL before 38 weeks of age. There is a trial currently being conducted that will have  impact on how Dr. Nicholson should design his trial. This is the ARRIVE Trial which is currently being  conducted in the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network which is studying IOL at 39 weeks vs expected  management of pregnancy in nulliparous mothers. The Utah TIC has made the following recommendations  presuming ARRIVE Trial data will show better outcomes for IOL at 39 weeks:  • Limit the study to two arms : IOL at 39 weeks and AMOR-IPAT  • Screen subjects with AMOR-IPAT during the screening process and only include those that will be  induced prior to 39 weeks.  • Keep the restriction to multiparous mothers.  • Provide specific guidelines to the participating physicians so there is less practice variability.  • Consider looking at common intermediate outcomes rather than less common severe clinical outcomes.  • Ensure all surveys measures used in the study are validated.  • Implement a governance committee to make determinations on defining terms in the protocol.  • Collect length of stay post induction for mother and infant (dates and times of admission and discharge)  to simplify costs collection.  • Simulation power calculations should be done for grant submission. Increasing projected enrollment will  likely be necessary.  Preparing a Strong Grant Proposal / Grantsmanship  Dr. Nicholson has been developing the AMOR-IPAT scoring tool over the last 20 year. He has submitted  grants in the past that have not made it to study session. The following recommendations were made:  • Stay in contact with the program officer, Uma Reddy and get advice regarding study section.  • Begin writing grant early.  • Have Penn State CTSI do a mock review of the grant; begin writing early; attend a grant writing  workshop.  • Submit grant in February 2018 or later, in order to incorporate the results of the ARRIVE Trial.  • Have a perinatologist and a neonatologist on the grant with a multiple PI plan.  Site Recruitment  Dr. Nicholson originally proposed that his study could be accomplished with five sites in total. During Phase II  of the consult, her proposed using three sites. The Utah TIC made the following recommendations:  • Intentionally include sites with different racial and ethnic demographics in order to evaluate  generalizability of the results to multiple races and ethnicities.  • Advise not to enroll at Hershey as this could introduce bias into the trial.

The investigator has  really got no data coordinating center, is not part of any existing network, and five to six large maternity centers  would provide sufficient numbers of births. Discrete services would be largely irrelevant for this study - he  would need comprehensive consultation to help him prepare a competitive R01 application, and he would need  soup to nuts implementation as a Trial Innovation Network study.

Aspects of this possibility and other potential operational hypotheses will be discussed during the comprehensive consult.	\N	t	t	t	Dr. Crane is planning a prospective randomized controlled trial of the AVR device. Patients with UVD who meet the entry criteria will be enrolled and given the AVR device in addition to instructions on standard vestibular rehabilitation exercises. During a 1 week run-in period prior to randomization the participants will complete a static visual acuity task.  The purpose of this run-in period is to allow people the opportunity to get used to the equipment and also determine the stability of symptoms prior to therapy(DHI will be measured at enrollment and at the end of the week, a visual analog scale will be used daily). After the run-in period patients will be randomized to either a placebo or the AVR task.  As with the run-in period the DHI will be measured weekly and daily (when the subjects login) they will complete the visual analog scale and also report whether they did the standard vestibular rehabilitation exercises that day. The trial will persist for 4 weeks. At the end patients who were given the placebo task will be given the opportunity to do the AVR if they wish.    Recommendations:  •\tSTUDY POPULATION: Consider adding a second subgroup of ACUTE unilateral vestibulopathy (vestibular neuritis) patients, in addition to the CHRONIC unilateral vestibulopathy patients to improve generalizability of the study population and results. Plan for STRATIFIED randomization for these two groups. This is an opportunity for TRIAL INNOVATION by pairing diagnostic trial (NIDCD-sponsored AVERT trial using video-oculography for diagnosing acute vestibular neuritis and related vestibular disorders) with therapeutic trial (self-administered vestibular rehab trial).  •\tSTUDY DESIGN: Patient-level randomization, 1:1 (intervention:placebo). There was agreement that a placebo comparison was most appropriate, given the novel and focused nature of the intervention (and lack of evidence on efficacy of specific sub-types of vestibular rehabilitation therapy. There was discussion about using a crossover design (in the placebo arm [crossover to self-administered rehab] or in both arms [crossover to standard 'live' vestibular rehab]); this is a topic for further focused discussion as part of a comprehensive consultation.  •\tSTUDY INTERVENTION: There was agreement that a focused, vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation-oriented rehabilitation strategy was most appropriate given the following: (1) many vestibular rehabilitation studies have used an extensive, complex battery (adaptation plus compensatory plus  substitution plus postural control exercises plus reconditioning, etc.), so studying one subset of these in isolation is both innovative and important; (2), more complex interventions are unlikely to be self-administered by patients at home, so more complex interventions are not readily scalable; (3) the most important ingredient for a study population of acute and chronic unilateral vestibulopathy patients is likely to be VOR adaptation. There is a need for further discussion in comprehensive consultation regarding allowable co-interventions and how to monitor them (self-report, standard activity level scales, devices [fit bit], etc.).  •\tMAXIMIZING ADHERENCE: Planned was a run-in period in which subjects who do not adhere are dropped from the study. We reviewed a prior study section critique about lack of follow-up in those who fail to adhere to the treatment, which would be relatively inexpensive. The main goal of the run-in dropouts was to avoid diluting the treatment effect, but this can be managed instead by using a per-protocol statistical analysis, rather than intention to treat, which would be appropriate for a Phase II trial. Consider instead eliminating the "run-in" period, randomizing all patients from the start, and using adherence as a target for a TRIAL INNOVATION by conducting a cluster-randomized, site-level meta-trial. For example, an escalating intervention to maximize adherence (e.g., email/text message reminder for 1 missed day; phone call reminder for 3 missed days; in person visit for those with technical problems) could be applied to half of the sites, randomly selected (or using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design). Further design considerations/logistics/budgeting would be part of a comprehensive review.  •\tSTUDY OUTCOMES: More robust patient-centered outcomes are needed for the trial. This issue was raised in a prior study section critique. While DHI is a specific vestibular/balance measure, it is not a quality-of-life scale, per se, but rather a functional impairment scale. Consider both a general, well-established QOL scale (SF-36... or SF-12 or EuroQoL-5D if a shorter instrument is needed) and some validated scales from the PROMIS library relevant to vestibular. Additional instruments/outcome measures should include validated measures of falls and gait/balance function. If participant burden is a problem, some physiologic measures could possibly be dropped. Further discussion of this issue would be part of a comprehensive review.	t	\N	t	2017-07-20 00:00:00	f	\N	\N	1	Yes the trial innovation and more specifically the JHU/Tufts TIC has the resources to support this proposal.  This proposal represents a key demographic of investigator that has a reasonably well defined trial but is new to clinical trials and as such stands to benefit the greatest from the expertise and resources the TIN can offer.	\N	1	f	\N	\N	2019-02-01 00:00:00	11	\N	t	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-06-05 00:00:00	Automated Vestibular Rehabilitation	t	2019-03-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	3	2022-12-31 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	Rhonda Kost	\N	\N	447	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	453	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-06-27 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	1	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	t	\N	\N	Clinical Trial of Automated Vestibular Rehabilitation Technique	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	Recruitment Plan, Budget and modifications to study design to make optimal use of the network.	2022-01-01 00:00:00	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	2	\N	2022-12-31 00:00:00	\N	Yes	f	t	Budget and modifications to study design to make optimal use of the network.	\N	\N	2022-11-01 00:00:00	Holli Hamilton	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	2018-04-01 00:00:00	Yes, this is a relatively small phase 2 study and does not present any resource barriers for the current stage of network development.	\N	\N	447	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-11-01 00:00:00	1	495	2019-03-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2	2017-08-16 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2022-03-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	1	\N	1	2022-04-01 00:00:00	t	Yes	\N	\N	\N	2018-10-05 00:00:00	\N	t	Definite opportunities for operational innovation  in addressing anticipated challenges to retention.	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	2	Investigator does not have a set submission date but is aiming for June 2018 submission.	2022-01-01 00:00:00	Investigator does not have a set submission date but is aiming for June 2018 submission.	499	Crane	\N	2022-04-01 00:00:00	1	[document]	t	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-11-02 00:00:00	\N	2018-06-05 00:00:00	2017-08-16 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	The identified potential enhancements to design, and approaches to retention improve its potential for successful funding.	\N	\N	\N	2017-10-30 00:00:00	\N	\N	2019-03-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	It was presented to the group that adherence is a major problem with this patient cohort. During the preliminary studies about half of patients who were eligible completed one or fewer sessions of the automated rehab.  Careful consideration needs to be given on how to handle this problem.  One suggestion was to supply a standard laptop to all patients to both create uniformity in training along with incentive to complete the rehab program.  Other possible ways to increase adherence in this population will be discussed during the comprehensive consult.	\N	\N	\N	453	\N	1	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Yes, it is a good project for the TIN and this TIC	2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-10-31 00:00:00	\N	Paul Harris	\N	f	\N	\N	f	\N	2018-10-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	1	Tiina Urv	2019-04-01 00:00:00	t	\N	2018-03-16 00:00:00	It seems like a good project given the number and type of enhancements the consultation can contribute.	2021-10-01 00:00:00	\N	1	t	\N	\N	2021-09-01 00:00:00	f	\N	\N	2019-04-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	1	170	t	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	f	\N	2	2018-04-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	2017-07-05 14:18:00	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	The intervention for this trial is home directed rehab exercises and as such comes at a low cost.

The grant was submitted yesterday, March 8th, 2018.  The final budget was worked on right up to the date of grant submission; therefore, it was not sent to the PAT for review.  At the present time the Investigator does not thave a protocol, we could provide the PAT the submitted research plan.    06-NOV-2017:  The Investigator (Dr. Barohn) shared his positive experience at the CTSA PI face to face meeting in DC.  The Investigator is currently deciding what central IRB will be used for his study (KUMC, Miami (CREATE), or JHU).  The RIC has also provided the Investigator with template language, which includes preliminary data from the phenotyping algorithm conducted across the RIC partner sites and TriNetX.  We are now in the process of scheduling a discussion with the Investigator to begin outlining our respective roles.  09-OCT-2017: The comprehensive consultation is on-going, no major roadblocks have been identified. The TIC and the RIC have conducted several discussions including: 3 Study Design Discussions, a Statistical Analysis Discussion, 2 RIC Recruitment Discussions, and 2 Central IRB Discussions. Follow-up calls will be scheduled in the upcoming weeks.   24-AUG-2017: A RIC follow up call is being scheduled for the beginning of October.   21-AUG-2017: A follow-up call to discuss "ALS neurophysiological secondary outcomes and pharmacovigilance" has been scheduled for September 7th.   11-AUG-2017: The RIC-TIC recruitment discussion has been scheduled for August 21st  1-AUG-2017: The first topic specific discussion of this comprehensive consultation has been scheduled for August 16th   06-JUL-2017:Kick-off meeting has been scheduled for 7/28/2017  30-JUN-2017: Investigator Follow-up call was held  28-JUN-2017: Decision Letter was sent to the PI  27-JUN-2017: Doodle poll for comprehensive consult has been sent, Investigator follow up call scheduled for 6/30/2017  16-JUN-2017: Initial Consultation results presented to the PAT Meeting	\N	\N	[]	[]	[]	[]

Possibility of using an adaptive sequential design  that would allow stopping for safety, futility or higher than expected efficacy.  2. Incorporating additional scientific innovation, such as predictive biomarkers for lung development, into the protocol.    Further opportunities to embed operational hypotheses will be evaluated during the comprehensive consult.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Study Design Recommendations  A preliminary review of the protocol and study design was made during the initial consultation. After reviewing the comments from NIH that Dr. Jelin received in response to his previous grant submission, it was recommended that some preparatory work was needed by Dr. Jelin before revisions could begin. It was advised that Dr. Jelin work with nephrologists to revise protocol aims and consider incorporating additional scientific innovation (e.g. predictive biomarkers for lung development) into the protocol. Potential new aims discussed were: Aim 1- lung function (safety/feasibility and short term to power the study) and Aim 2-time to peritoneal dialysis (survival for 6 months). Other outcomes measures were also discussed, including the need for follow-up on the number of patients who are transplanted to inform quality of life outcome measures. It was also recommended that Dr. Jelin consider including a senior PI with experience in securing funding on his grant. The funding mechanism and timeline for RAFT was also discussed and it was suggested that Dr. Jelin consider possibly submitting his study to a rare disease network instead of the intended R21 to NICHD.    Statistical Recommendations:  1.\tConsider pairing the expectant management group with subjects that are being enrolled into the treatment arm in order to ensure sufficient number of controls. It was also suggested to set the sample size for the study based on the number of subjects who receive the intervention and find either concurrent or historical controls matched based on demographic characteristics.  The sample size would be determined based on the width of the confidence interval for the primary outcome measure. We also discussed that the characteristics of controls  enrolled prospectively (and maybe retrospectively if available) can be compared to those who select to get the active treatment to support the assumption that there is no difference (medically) between eligible patients who do and do not get the treatment [since this is not-randomized this is the inherent assumption].    2.\tPossibility of using an adaptive sequential design that would allow stopping for safety, futility or higher than expected efficacy. Based on the fact that the necessary number of infusions and potential adverse events of treatment are not well known, this could help inform study design and study procedures in real time as data is collected and analyzed. It was also suggested that it might be worthwhile considering a mechanism for modifying the parameters of the intervention or inclusion/exclusion criteria as data accumulate during the study.    3.\tFraming as a pilot study.  A primary goal of said pilot would be to get an estimate of the intervention success rate (ex. start renal replacement) and a 95% confidence interval for that estimate;  That confidence interval could be compared to historical data (presumed rrt rate = 0%) and also to  the controls enrolled during the course of this study [also expected to be 0%]. The spirit being that this study would become less dependent on the # of controls enrolled to achieve study 'success', being that it seemed that this is more like a surgical intervention than a drug study so the standards for adoption are different (doesn't require FDA approval, only adoption by the community based on convincing outcome data).  The next study would have a larger sample size and focus on the long term outcomes.	t	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	The JHU-Tufts TIC has the resources and expertise necessary to successfully carry out a comprehensive consultation and provide CCC/DCC support of the trial if funded.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-05-01 00:00:00	55	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Renal Agenesis Fetal Therapy (RAFT)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mary Stroud	\N	\N	483	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	453	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2017-10-24 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	Fetal therapy for congenital bilateral renal agenesis	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	Operationalize Standard Agreement  Recruitment Plan	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Yes, the network has the capacity and resources to support this study.	\N	\N	461	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	499	2017-05-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	2017-10-24 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-02-05 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	Timelines will be fully evaluated and reviewed during the comprehensive consult.	\N	Timelines will be fully evaluated and reviewed during the comprehensive consult.	499	Jelin	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-02-19 00:00:00	\N	2018-02-05 00:00:00	2018-02-05 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-02-19 00:00:00	\N	\N	2017-05-01 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Burden on the research institution will be heavy post delivery and pre transplant.

The Department of Defense (DOD) for 3 sites letter was strongly supported and Dr. McClain provided a full submission.  The next step that the submitting PI wants to take is a re-submission to NIDDK.  They spoke with the NIH PO, Teresa Jones, and asked if NIDDKs requirement of a U34 could be waived if they are working with the Trial Innovation Network - they have not received follow-up.  Discussions continue around funding and budget and the TIC/RIC will assist with the NIDDKs submission.	\N	\N	[]	[]	[]	[]

However, there are some potential areas for innovation:     Opportunities for operational innovation:  1) Trial Design: Biomarker dose finding trial  2) Trial Execution: Bringing an experienced basic scientist together with experienced trialists  3)   Recruitment: Area for EHR-cohort assessment	\N	\N	\N	\N	There were extensive discussions around what acute injury would be the most desirable for a pilot study trial to demonstrate mechanism engagement. Should the focus be on TBI patients or Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/Intracranial Hemorrhage patients in the phase 2a study?  She envision this 2a study as a proof of concept trial that will allow us to get PD endpoints in humans and show engagement of mechanism.    Dr. Van Eldik's pre-clinical data is in TBI. However, TBI patients are a difficult patient population to perform a trial in due to the variability of the disease among patients and the lack of clear radiographic endpoints available. Also, there is an aim to collect CSF at various time points, however, most TBI patients do not have External Ventricular Devices (EVDs). During the discussion, several experts in the field (Jian Wang, Lauren Sansing, Wendy Ziai) expressed their advice on ICH/SAH patients to be the focus. Upon further discussion, specifically ICH patients were recommended as a preferred patient populations since ICH produces edema in the brain tissue, and is easier to assess and alter, compared to the vascular changes of blood vessels associated with SAH. Additionally, about 30% of ICH patients receive an EVD.	t	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	Yes, the JHU/Tufts TIC has the capacity to conduct a comprehensive consultation on this phase 2a study.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	122	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	TT301/MW189 Phase 2a trial	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mary Stroud	\N	\N	483	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Initial estimates were for $3-4 million for total study over three years.   50 patients with $60,000 per patient costs with potentially 8 sites  Suggest adding in an additional $1.5 million for DCC/CCC costs.

It was decided that "Early-ELI" was the most practical and feasible study design consisting of enrollment within 12 hours, a GCS range of 3-14, with a 6 hour infusion of sodium lactate and safety as the outcome of interest in a 3x3 design.    Study population: The large range of GCS values adds to the generalizability in studying the common form of TBI but introduces the potential for imbalance in safety outcomes.  The idea of adaptive randomization was initially discussed but may not be practical and needs to be further explored once other elements of study design are determined.  In place of adaptive randomization it was recommended that two different strata of GCS scores be enrolled simultaneously to their own 3x3 design to control for disease severity.    Sample size:  Recommendations include an adaptive trial design in which only patients in the treatment arm are enrolled to quickly achieve the maximum tolerated dose and then introduce randomization to begin preliminary study of efficacy and reduce the total number of patients needed.    Outcome: Initial study design included hypernatremia, defined as sodium level >160 mmol/L on two successive hourly readings, as a stopping rule for failing a dose.  It was recommended that a safety outcome be used such as arrhythmia or bronchospasm to confirm a major negative clinical outcome rather than a signal that may or may not represent such a clinical outcome of interest.    These recommendations will be further discussed and refined during the comprehensive consult along with budget and CCC/DCC task allocation.	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	Yes the sample number of sites and patients for this phase 2 study is well within the capacity of the TIN/ JHU-Tufts TIC	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	126	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	ELI in TBI	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mary Stroud	\N	\N	447	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	482	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-03-09 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Ideal dose and safety of exogenous sodium lactate infusion (ELI) in acute severe TBI patients	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	Protocol Design and Assessment of study feasibility	\N	0	\N	\N	453	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Yes sufficient resources exist to take on this study with the proposed submission of Oct 5.	\N	\N	447	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	499	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-06-05 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	2	\N	\N	PI targeting a R01 submission to NINDS for October 5.	499	Vespa	\N	\N	\N	[document]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-07-20 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2018-07-20 00:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Recruitment plan seems feasible for this population.  study Team aware of the importance of having strong study coordinator support for this time sensitive recruitment and administration of study procedures.

The Mayo Clinic will be the CIRB for this study.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The study team requested the RIC review their recruitment and retention plan and provide feedback. These recommendations were compiled and sent to the study team on 9/21/2018 along with the RIC Recruitment and Retention template and a link to the RIC toolkit. This feedback was also discussed in the kickoff call on 9/24/2018.     If the study team encounters challenges with participant recruitment and retention, they are welcome to circle back to the RIC to discuss opportunities for services.
Because of the large number of CTSA sites (20 of 21 total sites) planned for the U.S. population of this study, use of a central IRB through TIN would be beneficial.	t	The RIC discussed EHR-based cohort discovery during our initial consult.  Since Dr. DeBaun has already identified 20 sites that are CTSAs (exception of St. Judes) and have strong SCD programs. It was decided the more appropriate service would involve consults with local health information teams to incorporate recruitment methods into the workflow of electronic health records, e.g. MyChart.	\N	\N	t	2	Due to the prevalence of SCD in African Americans, the study would benefit greatly from a community engagement studio to inform recruitment and retention, as well as recommendations for culturally-appropriate recruitment materials.	\N	Also due to the prevalence of SCD in African Americans, the study would benefit greatly from culturally-appropriate recruitment  materials.	\N	\N	\N
TIC recommends providing CIB services to the study team. All three sites identified in the proposal are CTSA sites.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	The RIC can provide guidance and recommendations around modifications to existing and new informational and recruitment materials for the study	\N	TIC recommends providing SA agreement package to the study team as all 3 sites are CTSA sites.	Patients will be identified from the NICU population.  The select  ICU staff will serve as Research Nurses and will be able to screen and assess candidates for enrollment.  Familiarity with the patient and the family should help foster trust during the recruitment process.  Recommendations around continued engagement during the patient hospital stay and followup after discharge with cards and check ins to help retention were discussed.  The study team had already discussed ways to alleviate participant burden for the return visit by providing child care for siblings, and a set amount for food and gas reimbursement.  RIC suggestions included possible providing a snack since the follow up visit can be lengthy and providing return of results directly to the patients family members regarding the audiology exams.  The RIC can also help develop a plan for return of study results to the participants.
The Utah Trial Innovation Center recommends providing CIRB services for this project.    During the initial call, the Utah TIC discussed the following with the lead PI:  • Study currently funded. PI ready to submit study application via the Utah IRB and have them act as the CIRB.  • The Utah CIRB gave an initial Reliance Consult to provide education to the lead site regarding the Trial Innovation Network CIRB process and their CIRB responsibilities as a lead site.  • All 8 sites are CPCCRN sites and have all signed onto the SMART IRB Reliance Agreement and IREx and have been identified below:    1. University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)    2. Children's Hospital of Colorado (DECH)    3. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)    4. Children's National Medical Center (CNMC)    5. Nationwide Children's Hospital (NWCH)    6. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)    7. University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)    8. Wayne State University/ Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHOM)  • Reliance agreements will need to be placed for this particular study.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
\N	t	Cohort identification to better define the available patient population, aid in site selection, and help in modeling the enrollment plan will be provided by the Vanderbilt RIC.  This will include the standard set of "test" sites and it was suggested by DNT that the following additional sites be targeted:  1. Mass Gen  2. Wash U  3. Northwestern U  4. U of Michigan  5. UPMC	t	t	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N
Vanderbilt should be the cIRB;  if resources are a concern, Utah should be the cIRB.  All sites are CTSA Hubs or affiliates.  There are only nine sites.	t	The RIC discussed EHR-based cohort discovery during our initial consult.  It was decided the more appropriate service would involve consults with local health information teams to incorporate recruitment methods into the workflow of electronic health records, e.g. MyChart.	t	t	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	Chicago will negotiate the contracts, but the TIC that assumes cIRB responsibility will also provide consultation to their contractors if required for executing the standard agreements.	The RIC reviewed the draft protocol and recognized the project will need recruitment and retention assistance. In particular, the registry will need assistance recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups and younger individuals. The RIC proposes to use lessons learned from the precision medicine initiative to enhance the existing recruitment plan. The specific recommendations are as follows:    * Share lessons learned from the community engagement sessions conducted during the planning phase of All of Us program (precision medicine initiative). This information may inform future recruitment strategies of underrepresented populations.     * Provide  successful retention strategies and return of value propositions to retain populations in large registries, e.g. BioVU     * Illuminate existing pathways to access patients, e.g. CTSA Consortium and public private partnerships to increase the diversity of potential participants

-Representatives of the Utah TIC reviewed the general  process of initiating a CIRB.    -The University of Utah can act as the CIRB for this study.    -All 7 of the planned sites have signed the SMART IRB agreement, 6 of the 7 sites have registered with IREx.  -The Utah TIC will schedule a reliance consultation with the Utah IRB. During this consultation, the Utah TIC recommends the PI discuss:     -For Aim 1, whether an IRB application is needed since data already exist in the PECARN Registry     For Aim 2, what is the best way to handle the consent process for this aim, use of cover letter. Will this qualify for waiver of documentation of consent.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Use of CIRB in this study would be beneficial to take full advantage the CTSA network.  Planning to use the Huntington Study Group (HSG) sites but not all are identified. There is significant overlap between HSG and CTSA networks that can be leveraged in identification of sites.	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	1	Use of standard agreements in this study would also be beneficial to take full advantage of the CTSA network.

High level CIRB discussions occurred during the kick-off meeting, but a more in depth discussion will occur with the study team during the comprehensive consultation.  Use of CIRB in this study would be beneficial to leverage the CTSA network.  17 of 22 identified sites are affiliated with CTSA institutions. An additional 8 sites would need to be identified, which represents an opportunity to engage additional CTSA sites	\N	- EHR was briefly discussed during the call. This service may be vital to the identification of the appropriate population for this study.	\N	\N	\N	1	- The RIC provided a description of the community engagement studio. At this time a studio was not recommended but mentioned.	- Feasibility assessment will be incorporated into the discussion regarding EHR cohort assessment and recruitment planning.	\N	1	Use of SA in this study would be beneficial to leverage the CTSA network.  17 of 22 identified sites are affiliated with CTSA institutions. An additional 8 sites would need to be identified, which represents an opportunity to engage additional CTSA sites.	- The RIC provided an overview of the recruitment plan process. We would like an opportunity to further explore what a comprehensive recruitment plan might look like.
The investigators have decided to utilize the Cedars-Sinai IRB as the cIRB.    The investigators asked the consult team when it would be appropriate to submit for initial cIRB review and approval. The consult team agreed that initial submission could occur upon funding with modification/amendment as needed after the year 1 calibration period. However, the investigators raised the concern that the intervention may not be appropriately refined for IRB review until after year 1.	\N	See summary of Recruitment Assessment Recommendations.	\N	\N	\N	2	As part of a RIC consultation we will assess if a  community engagement studio would be the best method to obtain input from this  population.  This is a disenfranchised population where trust in the healthcare professional will be essential to successful recruitment.	\N	\N	\N	The FDP agreement was shared with the investigators. All three sites are CTSA sites and 2/3 have already agreed to utilize the FDP.	Due to the limited time frame surrounding the request for Initial consultation the RIC was not able to analyze and suggest potential ideas.  The RIC will provide a thorough consultation for RIC services should this proposal be funded.   Potential services could include:  community engagement studio, assistance with development of recruitment and retention plan, and assistance with development of recruitment materials specific to this patient population
We will approve CIRB services with the understanding that all enrolling sites (except OHSU) will have their academic center employees engaged in research at the rural clinics.  Regarding OHSU we will allow OHSU to handle local context for HIV Alliance but we will need HIV Alliance to cede review for the study.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
\N	t	EHR Cohort could potentially help identify individuals for general engagement in research and developing a pool of volunteers.	\N	\N	\N	1	A studio may be helpful in identifying population-specific recruitment methods and common barriers to research participation.	\N	This project would benefit from some general research awareness pieces. There was some discussion of hiring Big Duck, a marketing firm in NY.	1	\N	A comprehensive recruitment and retention plan for the development of the network will be necessary for project success.

The Utah Trial Innovation Center recommends providing CIRB services for this project. All CPCCRN sites have signed onto the SMART IRB Reliance Agreement and IREx. CPCCRN sites include:  Children's Hospital of Philadephia  Children's Hospital of Michigan  Children's Hospital Colorado  Children's National Medical Center  Nationwide Children's Hospital   University of California, San Francisco  University of California, Los Angeles  University of Pittsburgh Medical Center	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
\N	\N	The initial site list of 9 sites had been surveyed for possible number of recruitments per year.  These numbers can be further validated by running the electronic phenotype (to be created in comprehensive consult) at the 9 sites as well as any others that Dr. Aksamit chooses to pursue.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	It was briefly discussed that patients sometimes travel great distances to be treated at one of the centers included in this study and for this reason having follow-up visits at 2 wks, 4, wks, 8wks, 3 mos, and 6 mos might be a deterrent for enrollment.  Innovative ideas to balance the need for regular follow-up data while recognizing the burden of adherence to such a schedule for in-person visits needs to be further worked out in the comprehensive consult.	\N	\N	\N	\N
-Due to the fact that the participating community-based practices will not be consenting subjects, collecting data or performing procedures beyond standard care, the Utah TIC advises that participating community-based practices will not be engaged in research for the CASCADE Trial; therefore, reliance agreements will be needed only for the four main sites.  -University of Utah can act as the CIRB for this study. SMART IRB agreements are already in place with each site and each site is signed up to use the SMART IRB Exchange.  -Utah TIC advises to begin the CIRB submission process as soon as possible.	t	\N	t	t	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	-Utah TIC recommends OHSU negotiate FDP agreements with the four main sites. They will need to come-up with a fixed price budget. We advised OHSU that a cost reimbursable budget will become an accounting burden.  -Casi Morales can work as a navigator with OHSU's OPS staff to help them maneuver the TIC standard agreement process.	\N
CIRB is recommended and will leverage the strengths of the CTSA program for the project.  Approximately 64% of the proposed US sites are associated with CTSA institutions and are advancing through or have already completed CIRB agreements. Additional opportunity to include more CTSA sites exists with only 16 of the 25-30 sites identified to date. Currently 3 Canadian sites and 2 European sites are planned.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	Engagement Studio to assist with recruitment of minorities in this population.	Reaching enrollment goals will be difficult due to limited number of  minority subjects that meet criteria in only 25 sites.  Extending the grant to 7 years is also suggested.	Recruitment material aimed toward minorities.	1	Standard agreement services are recommended leverage the power of the CTSA program.  At least 7 CTSA-affiliated sites makes the use of SA advantageous for US sites and the submitting team is supportive of this strategy.	Assist with site selection.
Recommend to move forward with CIRB services. Budget information sent to PI for the proposal. A letter of support was provided.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

\N	\N	The WISDOM study team has put a great deal of effort into building a patient centered website, where people can independently enroll in the study. However, there needs to be more emphasis on wide-scale marketing and advertising that drives people to this website. The study has also created a sophisticated recruitment strategy in utilizing the EHR system.    Initial ideas:  •\tRefine EHR criteria and email invitation to participants who may be more willing to participate.   •\tReview the timing of when initial email invitations and follow up emails are sent.   •\tExpand the recruitment population/include additional sites.	\N	\N	\N	2	The input gained from studio participants can be used to identify key stakeholders that could assist with recruitment, provide recommendations on how to develop and refine the existing recruitment plan, and ideas to develop or amend for study templates and materials.     Initial ideas:  •\tGain feedback on the overall message of the study to participants.  •\tReview the web portal and identify areas where interested potential participants are dropping off.   •\tReview existing recruitment materials and consents for feedback which would provide good information to the recruitment plan and materials.	\N	The RIC can potentially provide support to review existing materials or design new materials if there is something the PI feels that the study is missing. We would likely work closely with the marketing lead with the Athena-Wisdom Central office to coordinate efforts with this service.     Initial ideas:  •\tFeedback from the Community Engagement Studio may be able to provide the best information for any changes regarding recruitment materials.	\N	\N	The RIC can potentially provide support by reviewing the current recruitment plan and materials, providing advice and recommendations to improve recruitment, and share best practices with the study team.     Initial ideas:  •\tThe study is heavily involved with recruitment through the study website and EHR identification/email invitations. Recruitment discussion could provide suggestions on process improvement with this strategy.   •\tReview of all key study stakeholders and study communication plan.  •\tCompletion of RIC Recruitment and Retention Template.  •\tReview status, use, barriers and effectiveness of the following recruitment and retention strategies as outlined in the study protocol.   •\tReview of implementation and effectiveness of contingency plans as indicated in proposal.

Discussed potential to use CES feedback to help develop a messaging system to parents and to review and revise consent forms and the consent process.	\N	Design and refine recruitment materials to include key messages: 1.) the decision to participate in the study doesn't necessarily mean agreement to use the medication and 2.) giving parents the best information to feel supported in decision making.	\N	The study team was interested in hearing about the standard agreements, but during a follow up call with the PI, they indicated they did not need these services as they already started the contracting process.	Recruitment planning could potential help prepare a "skeleton" recruitment and retention, filling in the blanks with the plan the study team already has in place. Discussed the potential to focus on solidifying plans for mitigating risk, process improvement, managing change during the study and developing plans for process and outcome evaluation.
The team reviewed the CIRB process with the team and agreed this would be a good collaboration.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	Important to focus on studio experts as "at-risk for condition" for dyad experts vs. actual TAVR patients. Attempts to include former TAVR patients willd be made. Focus can include:  •\tMessaging and timing of engagement  •\tGeneral barriers to agreeing to participate and suggestions on how to address  •\tFeedback to improve retention (if an issue)  •\tFeedback on decision-making aid/recruitment materials	\N	Discussed decision making aid, simplified for older population. Patient-facing app.    Investigator might also benefit from materials to distribute to the site PIs he will be recruiting at professional meetings.  Those PIs might value having something in hand to share with their site teams rather than ad hoc recall.	\N	Since this is an industry study, the study team could not use the CTSA-FDP.   There were some discussions about possibly using the ACTA or a modified ACTA.  Since the goal is not to slow down start-up the decision was made to further explore this option, but not to implement this at this time for the study.	Would be most beneficial after learning from key informant/medical or research team studio. Their expertise will drive the recruitment method, approach, and engagement timing.

This study team will leverage an existing relationship with the University of Miami IRB for the already established CREATE network sites, consisting of 13 institutions, with an additional 39 sites planned by the Investigator.  Rare Disease Clinical Research Network's (RDCRN) Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC), an NCATS supported program, will manage data for the 13 study sites and hopefully also an additional 39 sites that are expected.    The DMCC, at the University of South Florida, will coordinate data collection for the multicenter study and facilitate all IRB submissions on behalf of study sites.  Feedback received on a PCORI grant application was critical of the planned comparison of regulatory efficiency through work with multiple IRBs.  The study team agreed that in order to address PCORI's concerns the application needed to clearly identify how the existing infrastructure of the DMCC would be leveraged to facilitate central IRB review through the University of Miami.   Resistance of participating institutions to cede review in studies supported by the RDCRN in the past was described. Local full IRB reviews have been required by relying institutions in addition to a central IRB approval due to lack of familiarity of the relying sites with the local context review process. It was noted that the SMART IRB reliance agreement better defines the roles and responsibilities of the relying organizations and the reviewing IRB and should improve acceptability of use of a central IRB model. Although the TIC CIRB would not be providing the CIRB review services, it was noted that other aspects of the TIC CIRB process could be leveraged to help support the DMCC in its role. Specifically, the TIC CIRB could provide support in a) educating participating sites about the process for local context review, and b) helping to facilitate provision of local context information to the DMCC. Use of an educational arm of the TIC CIRB to support the infrastructure of the DMCC will help enable the DMCC to extend their capacity to include additional sites. Partnering with the University of Miami IRB could also provide an opportunity to test whether the use of educational interventions for improving understanding of IRB reliance models could improve operational efficiencies with CIRB review.    Recommendations for a comprehensive consult include:  Developing a CIRB model that would address PCORI review criticisms and allow testing of an operational hypothesis that could include:  -\tWorking with the DMCC and University of Miami IRB, implement TIC-generated training and support services for participating site onboarding.  -\tEvaluate whether the addition of limited TIC CIRB support, in a manner other than provision of direct review services, may minimize time and maximize efficiencies in a multicenter central IRB model.	t	\N	t	t	t	1	\N	Brief Summary of Assessment and Recommendations:   In general, a more thorough assessment of capabilities, strengths, and barriers amongst participating sites is warranted in order to determine overall recruitment feasibility.  The variation across centers makes it challenging to identify proper endpoints for analyzing recruitment as well as to identify how to construct a control group.  These factors make randomization between standard recruitment methods impractical.  Additionally, proper site selection and engagement will be critical when expecting participating sites to incorporate innovative recruitment methods.  Therefore, the RIC will work in partnership with the TIC in an effort to define best practices and novel approaches to recruitment that align with the overall study plan.    Recommendations for a Compressive Consult Include:   An ideal, feasible study design requires additional information from participating sites on recruitment resources and informatics capabilities.  The RIC will work to obtain detailed information from potential sites, likely by partnering with applicable Hub Liaison Teams, in order to determine overall recruitment feasibility.  Additionally, the amount of informatics resources that would be required from the TIN as well as from the participating sites, if applicable, would also be determined during the continued consultation.  The RIC would help to identify to what extent, if any, participating sites would feel an additional burden when exploring the various recruitment methods that would be considered.  Specific expertise on incorporating social media for subject recruiting would also be leveraged in order to determine the value of utilizing that platform for recruitment.	\N	1	\N	Brief Summary of Assessment and Recommendations:  Although critical to achieving target enrollment goals, and therefore to overall study success, novel approaches to recruitment have been historically challenging to implement.  The Investigator's initial plan of leveraging existing data within the CReATE/i2b2 registry comes with some advantages as well as challenges. Some advantages likely include a more streamlined, efficient way to identify eligible patients.  However, as much of these data are not captured in real-time, the Investigator must consider whether or not the enrollment window will have already closed once potential participants are identified within these existing datasets.  Additionally, IRB approval will be necessary in order to access existing data for recruitment into future trials.  Overall, the value of providing early education and awareness to participating sites surrounding implementation of novel recruitment methods is critical in order to ensure proper compliance with those methods.  Therefore, a comprehensive recruitment plan that considers how each site might have varying recruitment resources, the need for education surrounding novel recruitment methods, and a plan for assessing and reinforcing long-term commitment from participating sites will better ensure that the target enrollment goal is met within the proposed time period.      Recommendations for a Comprehensive Consult Include:   A comprehensive study consult will likely focus on the challenges and opportunities associated with incorporating the below methods at the various participating sites:  �\tAutomatic recruitment notifications developed to align with unique study phenotypes incorporated into various EMR templates  �\tIdentification of potential subjects found within existing research and/or quality datasets   �\tNovel self-identification methods for participants (possibly by utilizing ResearchMatch or other electronic survey methods that would expedite and assist with screening)  �\tIncreasing study awareness for clinical providers by embedding study information (i.e. hyperlink to study website with inclusion/exclusion criteria and study contact information) into applicable EMR templates  �\tRemote, limited access to EMRs in order to allow for central screening of potentially eligible patients at participating sites by the coordinating centers   �\tMarketing to participants by incorporating social media platforms   The comprehensive consult would aim to focus on determining which of the above proposed methods would be the most feasible and impactful and should therefore be incorporated into the study design. A comprehensive Recruitment Plan would then be tailored around the primary method for study recruitment and would likely also provide at least one additional method that could be considered as a secondary method if needed.
\N	t	\N	t	\N	t	3	\N	\N	�\tConsider indoor advertising at various clubs, bars/restaurants, sporting/concert venues where volunteers will see ads  o\thttp://www.bluelinemedia.com/restroom-indoor-advertising  o\thttp://www.headlinesindoor.com/nonflindex.html  �\tWe recommend making the IRB approved recruiting materials more aesthetically pleasing. Identify the study site that contracted with a graphic designer and inquire if other sites can use those materials. Click on the link for examples of flyers, post cards, etc. These are for other conditions but the design and aesthetics have been effective for other studies and seem to make the advertisements more noticeable.  o\thttps://vumc.box.com/s/mhh37acjdg8lz5qs336d753gfc8asr94  �\tConsider leveraging collaborating partner, UCLA, in partnering with Meth Inside Out in developing recruitment materials that are engaging. They also provide an extensive list of resources with links to support groups, advocacy groups, and other organizations that work with the study population.  o\thttp://methinsideout.com/index.html	\N	\N	�\tConsider conducting an informational (listening) session with the desired population and participants from the pilot study to determine where they get their news/information from in order to increase overall impact and desired outreach. For example, what venues would the study population most likely have an opportunity to be informed of this study? (e.g., TV and radio stations, meeting places, etc) And their thoughts on how recruitment might be enhanced for this study.  �\tConsider using popular dating apps for study advertisement. These apps have a broad reach and a screenshot of the study advertisement can be taken for reference at a later. Tinder, Grindr, Blendr, Tingle, Pure, and Down are some examples of apps to be further explored.  �\tConsider reaching out to either local or national support groups to explore using them as a place to advertise the study through.  o\thttps://crystalmeth.org/  o\thttps://meth.supportgroups.com/  �\tConsider contacting previous participants from the pilot, if allowed by the IRB, to see where they would recommend advertising and outreach.  �\tCreate small size business cards that could be distributed to others that may be interested.  �\tContact local women's clinics to place flyers there and so they can easily refer.  �\tConsider placing flyers in coffee shops, laundromats or grocery store bulletin boards.    Retention Recommendations: The populations at each of the study sites are quite different and may need customized approaches to retention.  �\tEncourage collaborating sites to identify barriers to participation and retention as participants enroll and work to develop strategies to overcome barriers proactively. This personalized approach shows the volunteer their participation is valued. Provide in-service training to the sites that do not currently do this; share lessons learned and best practices across sites.  �\tExplore ideas on how to leverage the study-provided smartphone to keep the study participant engaged. For example, allow entertainment apps to be downloaded (Netflix, games, Facebook, etc.) so the participant is more likely using it and can see study notifications as they appear.   �\tThe proposed study app is a straightforward recording and transmitting tool. Consider making the app more engaging. For example, utilize notifications to appear for reminders at certain time points, have encouraging study-relevant messages appear when the app is open to improve user experience.  Consider rewards for timely data uploads, etc.  �\tConsider extending clinic hours to accommodate the participant's schedules.  �\tAcross the study sites, explore various alternate transportation methods for participants who need reliable means to get to the clinic - Uber, Lyft, public transportation allowances.  �\tSchedule monthly Coordinator Recruitment Conference Calls for coordinators to discuss what is working and not working at their site in terms of recruitment and retention.

IRB Recommendations:  For grant application:  ­\tThe Johns Hopkins University (JHU) IRB provided Dr. Jelin with template text about JHM IRB as a sIRB for inclusion in his grant application.  ­\tJHU IRB also provided a template letter of support he can provide to relying sites to ask that they confirm willingness to rely on the JHM IRB.   ­\tJHU IRB will also issue him a letter of support for his grant application but do not plan to do so until he has confirmed the funding announcement he will respond to.     For CIRB review:  ­\tDr. Jelin provided a planned site list. JHU IRB verified all sites have signed onto the SMART IRB agreement.   ­\tJHU IRB provided Dr. Jelin with sample Step 1 instructions for onboarding sites to the JHM Letter of Indemnification. The Step 1 instructions will be sent to relying sites by Dr. Jelin/his research coordinator if he is not TIN-supported or by Cindy if he is TIN-supported.   ­\tJHU IRB informed Dr. Jelin that he cannot amend his existing single-site protocol to make it a multi-site protocol under the existing JHM IRB approval. He will need to submit a new study for CIRB review, and create a new protocol using the NIH protocol template. He will also need to de-Hopkinize the consent form and create a new template consent. Dr. Jelin will work on these documents and send to JHU IRB for pre-review.	t	EHR cohort discussed for identification of other possible sites.

Utah TIC Executive Director reviewed CIRB processes with PI and recommends CIRB services for this project.  Most likely the IRB will consider this registry to be minimal risk and expedited.  However, it will not be exempt since it is not anonymous. The following sites are designated as participating sites: Columbia, UCLA, UNC, UTMB, UTAH, Brandeis University, and UAB. In IREx all of the listed sites (above) except  Brandeis University (have not sign any agreements) are ready to register and cede review for the study.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	Overall target of 10,000 registrants over 5 years; 2000 participants enrolled per year; 167 participants enrolled per month to reach overall goal. A target of 84 women with CP and SB, respectively, will need to be enrolled per month to reach goal.    Having an agreement with the Cerebral Palsy Foundation will be instrumental in assisting with outreach to that specific population. Investigator might consider approaching either the Spina Bifida Association or the Spina Bifida Association of America for a similar agreement.	\N	\N	\N	The RIC will be happy to assist the Investigator with a recruitment plan, pending funding.
\N	\N	Site Selection (Sarah Nelson): Dr. Bazarian will work with the TIC to reach out to potential sites to gauge interest and confirm that the site does have an existing outpatient concussion clinic and gain an estimated volume.

Potential to use provider messaging as a tool.	\N	\N	\N	1	Potential Community Engagement Studio to focus on recruitment and retention of who the PI thinks would be the most challenging age group to enroll and keep in the study. Per initial discussions, the CES would probably be focused on adolescent populations.	We discussed developing a feasibility assessment to help develop criteria for eligibility and how that looks across the various sites.	A consent form specific to this study has previously been developed before the original grant submission was retracted. The RIC would be able to help create recruitment materials for this study.	1	\N	It would be beneficial for trained study staff to identify and approach potential participants and then flag the patient for the medical provider. Provider messaging may be an option, but we can explore other ideas as well. Another possibility may be to identify eligible participants prior to the visit date and then study staff can contact by phone and then plan to meet at the visit. We will develop this plan more as we learn how many participants the study seeks to enroll and how many sites are to be included in the network.
University of Alabama is the lead site and already has IRB approval. Site is under extreme pressure from industry sponsor to enroll in December 2017. The Utah CIRB Team has the following concerns:     - UAB wants to stay on their own local IRB approval and not transition to a CIRB.      - Allowing the lead site to remain on their local IRB approval deviates from the current Trial Innovation Network CIRB workflow. The lead site is an integral part of the CIRB TIN workflow and not having the lead site's participation in the CIRB has the potential to cause multiple disruptions resulting in CIRB delays.      - The PI needs about 6 additional sites - a potential mixture of community and academic centers.           -Of the three additional academic centers identified by the PI, the University of Florida has not signed on to the SMART IRB Exchange. This will cause delays in CIRB approval for this site.          -  PI needs about 3 additional community sites to meet his enrollment goal. If CIRB reliance agreements and assurances are not already established with these sites, this will cause a delay in CIRB approval.    Overall, the Utah TIC feels that we cannot meet the investigators aggressive timelines for getting CIRB approval for all sites and respectfully declines CIRB assistance for this study.	t	PI hesitant to proceed with 1) RIC EHR-based cohort assessment service as he is looking for very highly specialized sites and clinicians (with dedicated gout clinicians, substantial patient populations of refractory gout, and considerable experience infusing pegloticase - an uncommonly utilized therapy for severe gout) that he has already identified, and due to the PIs aggressive timeline.	t	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	The RIC offered assistance with recruitment materials, as well as additional recruitment advice and recommendations from the RIC toolkit. Again, presumably due to the aggressive timeline, the PI hesitated to proceed with assistance in these areas.	\N	1.\tContracts  a.\tIndustry Funding - University of Alabama already has a contract in place with Horizon which is not the Accelerated Clinical Trial Agreement (ACTA) so it is likely untenable to use the ACTA subcontract template.      b.\tFederal Funding - With Federal funding, ideally Trial Innovation Network projects would use the FDP CTSA Subaward Agreement.  However, since there will likely be a combination of both industry and federal funding subcontracting could become very complicated as neither the ACTA subcontract template nor the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) CTSA Subaward Agreement would meet their needs.  The TIC standard agreements group has not developed a template for a mix of both industry and federal funding.	\N
\N	t	The PI would like to use the EHR to identify records of patients who would be eligible and is interested in using the EHR to flag/alert these patients about the study and then potentially streamline to e-consent from there.	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	The PI has increased his recruitment goal to 20,000 participants; however, this goal does not take attrition into account so he will need to screen and enroll a significantly higher number. The screening goal will depend on the recruitment avenues that are put into place. Enrollment could be expanded to 2 years instead of limited to just the fist year.	There are currently no recruitment materials that have been developed for this study. The PI previously conducted a pilot study (MIGNES) and will share any existing materials and previous consents with the RIC so that these existing documents may be modified for this study.	1	\N	There is currently no detailed recruitment plan in place. The PI is interested in recruiting from primary care clinics, cardiology clinics, and other clinics that may yield a good number of potential participants.

The RIC can provide assistance with  the recruitment plan for this study in regards to the consent process.
\N	\N	The study PIs are considering adding a few more sites to meet recruitment goals on time. The RIC can provide guidance on US sites that have approached the PI with interest.  EHR-based Cohort Assessment: request EHR population counts for interested potential sites (CTSAs and their affiliates)	t	\N	\N	2	We do not recommend a CE studio at this time - the study team has an active Research Advisory Committee that includes former stroke patients and their caregivers - the committee meets semi-annually and can be utilized to provide additional feedback on recruitment materials, planning, etc.	\N	The RIC can provide templates and recommendations for design, content and general language for recruitment and retention materials.   - Family Guide: template examples for design and general language recommendations; tailored feedback after study team revises guide with template/general recommendations   - Participant Newsletter: template examples, as well as general language, content and design recommendations; tailored feedback after study team creates newsletter with template/general recommendations	\N	\N	The RIC can provide advice and recommendations to improve recruitment and share best practices with the study team.    - Recruitment Plan Revisions: advice and recommendations on current recruitment plan (e.g. coordination of site screening procedures, optimizing site performance)   - Study Coordinator Consultation: up to 10 hours of consultation time for team to reach out to RIC for advice and guidance as site issues arise .
The Utah Trial Innovation Center recommends providing CIRB services for this project. During our consultation, the Utah TIC reviewed Trial Innovation Network CIRB processes and educated the investigator on the lead site's responsibilities when submitting a CIRB application through the Utah TIC.     It appears 4 of the 5 FWA's sent to the Utah TIC are not signed up to the SMART IRB Master Reliance Agreement. Dr. Bowen's team confirmed that these local site are equipped to handle human subjects over site locally. The Utah IRC is not able to start CIRB work on the project until it is funded; therefore, we recommend that the investigator and her team reach out to the sites that are not signed up on SMART and inform them about the necessity of signing the SMART IRB Master Reliance Agreement as well as registering on IREx portal.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
\N	\N	Funds are not available to pay sites for participation.    This study only involves three sites.  EHR Cohort will not be beneficial in this case.	t	\N	\N	4	\N	\N	RIC will search for and send instructional tools for the device to the Project Manager and study coordinators.    RIC suggested actually demonstrating the devices during the consenting process so patients will be able to see the device and make a truly informed decision about participation.	\N	\N	RIC will assist the study Project Manger  in standardizing the enrollment log to better capture why subjects are not being enrolled in the study.  RIC will re evaluate the enrollment logs at 3 and 6 months and provide feedback to the PI.  RIC will search for and send instruction tools for the device to the Project Manager and study coordinators.
CIRB services are recommended due to high proportion of CTSA sites participating in the trial (5 of 6).

-The PI conducted a previous single-center pilot study at UC-Davis, which also acted as the local, single IRB. A waiver of informed consent was obtained for initial enrollment. The UC-Davis IRB also required that community consultation be done by the Investigator (even though EFIC was not required). Research staff were required to obtain written informed consent and assent (which was typically obtained later during the ED or hospital visit) for the follow-up portion of the study.    -For the proposed trial, it is believed that a waiver of informed consent for initial enrollment and subsequent written informed consent for follow-up will be adequate and that EFIC will not be required.	t	-Because the Investigators discussed the potential to expand beyond 6 sites (to potentially total 8 or 9 if funds allowed), the RIC representative discussed the opportunity for the Investigator to utilize the EHR cohort service, which can assist with the identification of sites who would have the potential patient populations based on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial.    -It is also understood that this proposal comes from a pre-existing network (PECARN - Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network) that may need to take specific network requirements and performance metrics into consideration when selecting sites for network studies.	t	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

-Representatives of the Utah TIC and IRB reviewed the process of initiating a CIRB. The responsibilities of the each party were explained along with the tools available.  The tools discussed specific to this trial were SMART IRB Agreement, SMART IRB Exchange, Informed Consent Builder, and ERICA (Utah IRB platform).  -University of Utah can act as the CIRB for this study.  5 of the 5 proposed sites have already signed up to use the SMART IRB agreement and all 5 sites have already signed up to use the SMART IRB exchange agreement.  -4 of the 5 sites are CTSA sites	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
\N	\N	EHR cohort assessment was discussed as a possibility to assess feasibility of the existing sites. It would be a smaller scale assessment. This may help to bring on one more site to capture more of the minority populations that may be included in this study, e.g. African American, Latino and Asian women.	\N	\N	\N	3	The RIC believes a community engagement studio conducted by the Mayo Office of Community engagement could be a beneficial link for the development of this grant proposal. The Mayo team has been trained to conduct community engagement studios. Rationale: The PI and team could leverage the expertise of lay community members to enhance and refine current recruitment and retention strategies. Community experts would be helpful in identifying barriers and facilitators to recruitment and retention. This information could then be folded into the R&R plan.	Feasibility will be assessed if we move forward with a small EHR cohort assessment.	We discussed recruitment materials. We recommend that the PI and team think about messaging to participants. Perhaps write up a narrative about why this study is important and why it should be important to postmenopausal women.  Side note: We recommend that the team no longer refer to the people participating in the study as "subjects". They should be either women or participants.	\N	\N	We recommend that the PI and co-investigators have a realistic recruitment and retention plan. They should think through the participant journey to help them identify where, why and how participants may enter and leave the study. This will also be a useful exercise to determine how much staff and additional resources are necessary to move forward with recruitment and retention activities.
\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Since this is a minimal risk study would suggest use of remote electronic consent to help alleviate any concerns regarding coercion of participants and streamline maintenance of consent form documents.

\N	t	Recommendations - None given at this point - appears as if it will be straight-forward for the RIC to easily run for the study.	t	t	t	1	\N	�\tWe encourage the Investigator to ask for more information from each of the individual site to show that the current recruitment estimates are realistic, and to include this information in the grant application. We suggest that the Investigator requests/includes the following information from the sites:  o\tA flow of patients that fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Detailed information about the inclusion/exclusion criteria are critical for estimating patient flow into the study.  However, we realize that this information is often difficult to obtain.  Where it is not available then modeling estimates would be important.  o\tPrevious recruitment history.  Again, this needs to be specific if it is going to be useful in making comparisons between these data and the predictions in the application.   o\tHow participants are approached and consented.  o\tHow cooperative the sites have been with the Investigator's site in past studies. This should be quantified, if possible.  o\tParticipants' attitudes toward research.  �\tWe would also recommend that the investigator address how the study will be attractive enough to potential participants and their loved ones to take the 50 percent chance of medicine vs. placebo.  �\tFor incentive payments, we would propose that the Investigator justify this in terms of time spent and financial incentives.  The research finding on incentives is not clear but some evidence indicates that larger amounts do work better; however, larger amounts are also related to perceived risks associated with the study.  Moreover, some studies indicate that payment, in contrast to lotteries, are more cost effective.  �\tIf incentive payments are going to be used then the study should include testing the participants on their knowledge of the risks associated with the study to help convince IRBs that the incentives are not 'undue influences' on the participants' judgments.  �\tIn terms of retention, we would recommend that the Investigator include more details about the retention plan in the grant application.	We encourage the study team to create recruitment materials/messaging that are directed to loved ones of those with memory changes, with clear messaging of which symptoms to look for, a study description, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.	1	\N	�\tThe investigator has chosen sites with extensive experience in cognitive studies, including NIH-funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. In addition, we would recommend that the investigator choose sites with experience in minority recruitment as well as active ResearchMatch sites.  �\tTo help with participant identification, we would recommend mapping inclusion/exclusion criteria to easily identified EHR variables.   �\tTo make the study more attractive to potential participants, we would encourage the investigator to consider a 2:1 randomization of study drug to placebo (rather than 1:1). However, we realize that this reduces statistical power so that the tradeoff needs to be made explicit.   �\tTo make the study more attractive to study partners, we would suggest paying them for their time and effort and possibly as an incentive as well.  �\tFor retention efforts, we recommend that the sites have planned strategies for building and maintaining relationships with study participants and their study partners. This includes regular check-ins, appointment reminders, birthday and holiday cards, newsletters, fact sheets, websites, and connections to helpful clinical and community resources.   �\tWe also recommend considering other areas to return value to participants. These include the option to return validated health results (with participants and their physicians) that would not interfere with the study.

The University of Utah will be the data coordinating center. The enrolling sites will be:  Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Children's National Medical Center, and University of Oklahoma Health Science Center.    During the consultation, the Utah TIC provided education to the lead site regarding the Trial Innovation Network CIRB process and their CIRB responsibilities as a lead site. We are happy to provide a copy of the CIRB consultation slides presented by Annie Risenmay if the study team will find this helpful.

The NYU IRB will act as the sIRB for this study. A Trial Innovation Network "CIRB Lessons Learned"  presentation was offered to the study team but eventually declined after further discussion. Dr. Reynolds has identified 100 sites/PIs through the   International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) network.  She would like to recruit 105 more sites for a total of 205 sites in US and Canada. Aim to enroll 2100 patients in US/Canada; 75% in US; 25 % in Canada. Sweden and Australia are additional collaborators.	\N	This study would benefit from an EHR cohort assessment in order to assist with the recruitment of additional sites and identification of eligible participants at each of those sites. The proposal currently has 100 committed sites (20 of which are CTSAs), and is currently looking for an additional 105 sites. We will plan to work with the PI and study team to develop a phenotype and EHR assessment across other CTSA sites and their affiliates.	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	This study could benefit from recruitment materials. We discussed the study team's interest in a mechanism that allows for patients to self-refer, and also engaging with physicians at community hospitals to refer their eligible patients to this study.

However the study team was not interested in pursuing this service at this time. If funded, we are available to assist with recruitment and retention planning, if needed.
Since this study is industry-sponsored, the use of Central IRB is not a requirement. It is only required for federally funded studies. Additionally, since this study is minimal risk then it might be conducted under a waiver of consent and considered exempt. We suggested PI write a summary letter explaining why the study is exempt and ask the participating sites to submit this letter to their local IRBs with the study proposal. We suggest also asking the sites to confirm their IRB fees ahead of time before submitting an exempt study. This will help anticipate correct budgeting costs.	\N	PI has previously reached out to 30 hospitals regarding the study and 20 responded; Site selection was based on who had done the procedure and sites in the CTSA network;     We discussed the possibility of an EHR-Cohort Assessment to see if the sites had identified the accurate number of patients reported. However, the PI declined this service since each site has so few patients who have undergone this procedure and are well-known to the site teams. The PI is confident in the numbers reported. Also, since there is no code for this procedure and is off label, finding these patients in the EMR would not be possible.	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	\N	Since this study is industry-sponsored, using a Central IRB is not a requirement.

Topic 3: Central IRB Discussion Summary  Upon review of the initial information about the IMMEDIATE-2 trial, the following were included as summary recommendations from the JHU TIC CIRB:    A. Consent and Use of Legally Authorized Representatives  As clinical trials that will be conducted under the Exception from Informed Consent [EFIC] regulations have specific regulatory requirements related to efforts that must be made to attempt to secure consent from a legally authorized representative (LAR), the TIC CIRB noted that the expansion of the study design to include in-hospital administration might trigger a heightened need to develop a plan that incorporates use of a legally authorized representative, where feasible.  To further advise on any requirements related to the use of an LAR, the TIC CIRB requested a copy of the following:  1. The IMMEDIATE Trial protocol, including any outline of how consent via LAR was factored into the consenting plan for the original trial.  2. Data on the number of subjects enrolled in the IMMEDIATE Trial [which included only a population where interventions were initiated in the ambulance] who were initially consented using an LAR.     B. Community Consultation   The TIC CIRB noted that one unique aspect of studies conducted under the EFIC regulations is the requirement for development and implementation of a community consultation plan, through which the potentially impacted community might provide feedback on the trial. It was noted that this requirement necessitates a two-part IRB review- first a review of the proposed community consultation plan and the trial as designed and then, subsequent to the conduct of the community consultation initiatives, a second review which includes feedback from the consultation where the protocol may gain full approval if all IRB concerns are addressed. Because of the unique requirements related to community consultation, the TIC CIRB noted one item that would be considered is how to effectively solicit local feedback on the planned consultation activities. This is something that would be more fully explored in a comprehensive consultation. To assist with a more in-depth consultation and assist the study team in developing an appropriate timeline, the TIC CIRB requested the following:  1. A copy of the community consultation plan created for the IMMEDIATE trial and a summary of any changes made to the protocol and/or consent documents as a result of the consultation activities from this first trial.   2. Confirmation as to whether a draft of the community consultation plan had been developed and incorporated with the grant application for the IMMEDIATE trial.     C. Site Identification, use of the SMART IRB Reliance agreement, and FWAs  The TIC CIRB noted that a critical next step will be site identification, as ideally, the grant application would include a) letters of support from each participating site that the site is willing to rely on the JHU TIC CIRB as the IRB of Record for this study and b) verification that each site is a signatory to the SMART IRB Reliance Agreement. The process for participating site onboarding to the SMART IRB Reliance agreement, through the assistance of the SMART IRB Ambassadors, was discussed. It was noted that one complication may include the fact that some local community hospital sites do not have a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) and having an FWA is a requirement for executing a joinder to sign onto the SMART IRB Agreement.  A link was provided to the study team to enable the team to cross-check the study sites for the IMMEDIATE trial and confirm which sites used in the original trial have an active FWA.     D. Recommendations for a Comprehensive Consult   The following services might be offered by the JHU TIC CIRB if a comprehensive consultation is pursued  1. Phase I [Prior to Grant Submission]:  a. Site on-boarding to the SMART IRB Reliance Agreement. Once study sites have been selected, the JHU TIC CIRB will share the list of participating sites with the SMART IRB Ambassador team [Harvard] to ensure the Ambassadors prioritize onboarding of the identified sites to the SMART IRB Reliance Agreement. These Ambassadors are dedicated to providing step-by-step support for the joinder process. For any identified sites that do not yet have an FWA, the JHU TIC CIRB can provide assistance/instructions for securing an FWA prior to signing the SMART agreement.   b. Provision of template letter of support participating sites can sign to confirm they have signed onto the SMART Reliance Agreement, are willing to use the agreement as the basis for reliance and are willing to rely on the JHU TIC CIRB [for inclusion with the grant application].   c. Review of the grant description outlining the planned use of the JHU TIC CIRB, including provision of a full description of the JHU TIC CIRB's capacity to serve as a single IRB, assistance with the development of the communication plan for working with participating sites and provision of a letter of support indicating the JHU TIC CIRB's willingness to serve as the single IRB for this study.   d. Review and feedback of preliminary drafts of the community consultation plan and development of a plan for incorporating local participating site feedback in the review of the appropriateness of this plan.      2. Phase II [Prior to IRB Submission]:  a. Assistance with the development and preliminary review of the community consultation plan including development of a plan to engage local participating site designees in the provision of a "local review" of the planned community consultation activities and their appropriateness for the targeted local community.  b. Preliminary review of the protocol to identify any regulatory concerns, including potential concerns with the planned consent process and the use of an LAR, where applicable and appropriate.	\N	See recruitment section.	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	See recruitment section.	\N	\N	\N	See recruitment section.
This proposal involves two studies, a Phase IIb randomized clinical trial and a prospective observational registry study.     9 sites are planned to participate.     The grant is currently under review with anticipation of funding starting in June/July 2018. The protocols would likely be submitted for CIRB review in 2018 as well. Although the plan is to submit both trials concurrently for CIRB review, if the FDA wishes to see changes in the clinical trial protocol, it is possible the observational study would be submitted first.     While this specific group of sites does not have an extensive experience working together it is felt there is adequate coordination across sites to help facilitate the CIRB review process.     One of the items we sought to verify as part of the consultation was the planned number of VA sites. It is my understanding that there will only be the 1 VA site for the Alcoholic hepatitis clinical and translational network data coordinating center study with another that plans on potentially recruiting some patients from a VA center.  There are no overall concerns for agreeing to provide CIRB services for these studies other than the fact that this would be another case for which we are not the only IRB [e.g. VA central IRB would be reviewing as well].	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

Challenge: Requesting feedback on the current EFIC plan    Discussion Summary: Dr. Ann Johnson, associate director of the University of Utah IRB, Dr. Jill Baren, physician and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Dixie Thompson, clinical research manager of the University of Utah's CCTS, and Jill Jannsen, director of Vanderbilt University Clinical Trials Center, joined this discussion via phone.  Dr. Balamuth reminded the group that they will be using exception from informed consent (EFIC) for this trial given the extremely short therapeutic window of 15 minutes.  The requirements for EFIC were reviewed.  The group began by discussing the requirement to obtain informed consent after enrollment.  Dr. Johnson reviewed the FDA requirement, which directs the study team to obtain informed consent as soon as is feasible and to document that information about the study was given to the parent or LAR.  The easiest way to capture this is to have an informed consent document signed. The discussion then shifts to the process of community consultation.  Dr. Weiss would like to use two ED/PICU focus groups, a survey to the community, an internet based communication, and social media.  Dr. Johnson suggests centralizing the community consultation process so that it may not be necessary to have focus groups at each site.  Dixie Thompson suggested using the CTSA Hub engagement resources assist with the community consultation.  It is unclear at this point, if each site in the proposed list of sites has a CTSA Hub resource.  Jill Janssen offered to see if the recruitment innovation center (RIC) could assist with the surveying.  Dr. Weiss presented the plan for public disclosure for the group's review.  The plan will include posters, flyers, brochures in the ED/PICU, Internet communications, internal communication to providers, and letters to referring physicians in appropriate subspecialties.  The group was in agreement with this plan.  The timely approach for the option to withdraw was also discussed.  Dr. Weiss' current plan would approach the family or LAR on the next business day.  Dr. Baren suggested approaching as soon as feasibly possible.  Patients would also be given the option to opt out prior to the start of the trial.  After public disclosure, those who wish to opt out would be given a medic alert bracelet to notify any clinician of their decision.  The group expressed agreement with this plan.    Recommendations:  1. Approach family or LAR for written informed consent & the option to withdraw when feasibly possible  2. Utilize the CTSA Hub resource and/or the RIC for assistance with the community consultation  3. Ensure CTSA resources are trained & provided guidance on what constitutes meaningful community consultation  4. Continue with current public disclosure plan  5. Continue with current opt out plan	t	\N	t	t	\N	1	\N	See "Provide a brief summary of Assessment and Recommendations" response above.	\N	1	Challenge: Who should be managing the standard agreements?

-Representatives of the Utah TIC and IRB reviewed the general  process of initiating a CIRB.    -The University of Utah can act as the CIRB for this study.  All six sites have signed the SMART IRB reliance agreement and four of those have also signed the SMART IRB Exchange agreement.  -The Utah TIC recommend the PI to follow-up with the sites to determine which institutions are engaged in research.  Each institution that has an FWA and is engaged in research will need to be contacted for the CIRB.  -The PI should notify the Utah TIC once the funding score for the grant has been released.  After which a more in depth training of the systems used for CIRB will be reviewed.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

\N	Not knowing this research team or this specific population, my initial impression is that the recruitment plan may be overly-optimistic, but the project is certainly very important and that only concern only means the RIC could have significant impact that will reflect very favorably on the TIN. Overall, I think the project has a high success potential and seems likely to get funded.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Steve Mayo	1	t	206	\N	\N	Lori Poole	Ed Kuczynski	\N	2	\N	\N	This appears to be a specimen registry. and the network is providing services.

The Investigator is an experienced trialist and has a strong research team, all of who have been extremely engaged with the TIC and RIC. Dr. Barohn is a CTSA PI, and the PI on many federally and foundation funded clinical research studies for rare neuromuscular diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, inflammatory myopathies, and muscular dystrophies. He holds leadership positions in the Muscle Study Group and Western ALS Study Group, and thus has a great deal of experience working with investigators in multi-center consortium trials. He also holds the IND authorization for 4 drugs currently under study (mexiletine, methotrexate, arimoclomol and rasagiline).	t	\N	t	t	t	t	\N	t	\N	\N	5	\N	\N	\N	Marianne Gildea	f	Steve_Mayo	t	\N	t	\N	\N	t	\N	Mike Dean	Gordon Bernard

2	Study seems to be at a high risk of failure even after RIC support due to lack of funding and short grant time remaining. Some simple solutions might help, but it seems the biggest barrier is not being able to compensate the sites as well what seems to be a significant patient burden.	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	Steve Mayo	\N	\N	223	\N	\N	Lori Poole	Ed Kuczynski	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	7	\N	\N	\N	Marianne Gildea	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mike Dean	Kanecia Zimmerman

2	The IC report does suggest that the trial could be successful. The bigger question might be in regards to the generalizability of the results to the US population and how much impact the TIC/RIC would be able to have in a mostly ex-US study. Those concerns withstanding, proceeding to comprehensive seems warranted.	\N	Qualified team, able and willing to collaborate and align with the mission of the TIN and CTSA program.

The grants cover the range of problems he wishes to address in this proposal submission. He has sufficient institutional support and will be able to provide adequate oversight for this trial since his obligations will decrease between now and 2020.	t	\N	\N	t	\N	t	\N	t	\N	\N	5	\N	\N	1	Marianne Gildea	\N	Dan_Hanley	t	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mike Dean	Gordon Bernard

RIC to remain available to the Investigator should they encounter any recruitment and retention issues throughout the course of the study.     Rationale for recommendation:  - Requests for a Database build and DSMB support are not services that are currently offered within the TIN.    - Opportunity for operational innovation is limited given the funding status, timing of the requests,  and limited CTSA exposure (3 sites all at 1 CTSA).  - Experience of the investigator and team at Mayo appear to be more than adequate to successfully design and conduct the study.  - Recruitment feasibility assessment suggests they have an adequate budget for recruitment and sufficient patient population. In addition, they have addressed subject compensation and outlined how they will identify subjects in a timely manner for enrollment.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	[]

How does this work with confidentiality disclosure?  •\tLarge companies are not interested in problems like this because they represent as major drain of money and public disclosure problem. They put risk on small investors.   •\tPeer review needs to address questions of funding and conflict managements   •\tMike Dean: Study worth doing a CC on; doing a CC should not mandate implementation; PR is important and can be done in parallel with CC, not before CC.   •\tMarianne Gildea: what might NHLBI provide? - no commitment from that IC at this stage in funding. Funding regulatory support to prepare investigator brochure and IND.  •\tGordon Bernard: big pharma didn't pick up because it is high risk and crowded field; we would be outside IC view. Has to be compared against other similar projects, and there aren't any.     •\tThe phase I study is an ongoing FDA study that is required to go with the phase 2 study. The final go ahead for the IND will come with a final phase 2 research plan and the results of the phase 1 study.  •\tMonica Shah: We wouldn't even start enrollment until around 2019. By that time, we will have more in our pipeline, and will need to consider capacity. Will need to work out details related to timeline  •\tPaul Harris: As long as we our comfortable with the PR question and this not being an institute-funded trial.

She also felt it is a doable project based on their experience.   •\tDan Hanley questioned how much coordinator time the scheduling and media reach out will take. Mary responded indicating that scheduling had been discussed and it was proposed to coordinator exercise studies along with clinic visits to cut down on appointment frequency for patients. She also mentioned figuring out a way to reach the patients through social media, building a website related to healthy living and exercise, and sending out check-in texts at least quarterly. In speaking with pediatricians, as far as scheduling, there is need to engage parents as well, but in terms of patient engagement with the study, they can reach out solely to the adolescent.  •\tMary Stroud stated that if the PI can get buy in from the healthy kids primary care physicians, it could work. She mentioned options given to the PI to make kids ambassadors to the study, to earn service hour credit for participation, and just make visits convenient (study follow-up alongside of another clinic/appointment visit).  •\tDan Hanley believes the study is feasible, and asked if rather than focus on feasibility, would it be better to look at estimate of timelines (on time, faster than scheduled or run over?)  •\tMonica Shah brought up the patient to budget ratio being high, and that the PI is asking for support from NCATS which can be a big commitment to one investigator if this goes through. Do we want to ask for reimbursement and revise budget or is it an in-kind service?   •\tMike Dean and Danny Benjamin are not concerned about recruitment becoming an issue, but Danny is uncertain if they will receive the funds.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	8-10 hrs	\N	f	\N	\N	t	\N	f	f	t	t	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	[]	[app_services_pat_outcome___5,app_services_pat_outcome___4,app_services_pat_outcome___2]

The aim of the study is to compare the acute use of optimized/image guided EVD placement combined with alteplase (first 12-48 hours from diagnostic CT), with the goal of > 85% removal of clot, with standard practices including EVD alone and conservative (non-surgical) treatment of large intraventricular hemorrhage ≥17.5 mL).  Randomization allocation will 1:1 between image-guided EVD + alteplase and Standard Care Practices.    Effectiveness Trial:  The Effectiveness phase will be predicated on   demonstrating a 10% shift in mRS and mortaltiy in efficacy trial.  This   unblinded study is designed to test if use of the CLEAR IV selection criteria   and treatment endpoint produce similar results to the Efficacy trial in a general population of IVH subjects where the stroke teams are trained but unmonitored. This is a step wedge cluster randomized trial design in which the intervention (early use of optimized and/or image guided EVD placement and alteplase within 12 to 48 hours of diagnostic CT) is introduced over a number of time periods, the order in which each cluster begins the intervention being determined at random. All clusters (sites) will receive the intervention by completion of the trial. Once a site switches to the intervention, it does not switch back to the control (standard care). The primary outcome is a comparison of 30 day mortality and functional outcome as measured by the percent of subjects returning home in 30 days between subjects in the effectiveness and efficacy trials.	\N	\N	207	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Early (first 12- 48 hours) acute use of image-guided, targeted, dual EVD placement and up to 12 doses of intraventricular thrombolytic (alteplase, 1 mg) administered every 8 hours.	1	291	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	75	\N	2	\N	Efficacy Trial    Primary objective: To determine if early (first 12- 48 hours) acute use of image-guided, targeted, dual EVD placement and intraventricular thrombolytic (alteplase) with the goal to remove >85% of clot will lead to improved mRS and mortality compared to standard practices.    Secondary objectives:   To determine if patients receiving EVD + alteplase in contrast with patients receiving EVD alone or conservative management attain better scores on the secondary measures of efficacy, which include:            (1)  whether 30 day mortality and disposition (site at which subject resides) predicts 180 day mortality and mRS/eGOS (extended Glasgow Outcome Scale) status;       (2)   whether mRS and eGOS correlate with patient perceived well-being as measured by SIS, EQ-VAS and subject location at 180; discharge to home / rehab correlates with mRS/eGOS status;        (iii)  Demonstrate that performance of the CLEAR intervention does not vary by site    Effectiveness Trial    Primary objective:  To test if use of the CLEAR IV selection criteria and treatment endpoint produce similar results to the Efficacy trial in a general population of IVH subjects where the stroke teams are trained but unmonitored.  We propose to test the hypothesis that early use of image-guided EVD and alteplase will produce improved 30 day mortaility and functional outcome as measured by percent of subjects returning home in 30 days.   Secondary objectives:   (1) To demonstrate that compliance with interventional goals relates to mortality and functional benefits    (2) To verify that compliance with safety plan for EVD-related minor bleeding correlates with the overall rate of delayed, treatment related secondary hemorrhage.    (3) To show that  major variations in selection are not associated effect including:        (a) time to treatment,        (b) subgroups by disease severity do not differ in their response to treatment, and        (c) subgroups stratified by co-morbidities such as The Charleson Index and an the do not differ in complications or response to treatment.

Study population includes all ED nurses, site leaders and adolescent ED patients (12-17 years screening positive on the NIAAA two-question alcohol screen survey) from participating institutions. ED patients will be screened using the PEDI-SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey (containing the NIAAA two-question screen). Those patients screening negative on the screen will not be included; their results will be discharged and not analyzed.	155	Staff:  All ED nurses and the identified site leader(s) from each participating institution will be included in the study.    ED patients:  Inclusion/exclusion criteria for ED patients includes:  a) between the ages of 12-17 years; b) treated in one of the participating EDs; c) screened positive for AOD use based on PEDI SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey; d) fluent in English or Spanish; and e) able to provide written assent and parent able to provide written consent.  Exclusion criteria include: in police custody, being evaluated by child protective services, in state custody, ED visit for suicide attempt and any acute conditions that would preclude provision of informed consent (i.e., acute psychosis, altered mental status, cognitive impairment).	\N	Primary Aim: Implementation Effectiveness: During the 1-3-day follow up, we will administer the Adolescent Perception of SBIRT Services Survey to enrolled patients via REDCap.  Using the NIAAA two-question screen Risk Algorithm, we will calculate site-specific rates for: a) use of NIAAA two-questions screening, and for those screening positive, b) computerized AOD brief intervention (BI), c) review of personalized feedback from computerized BI by ED nursing staff, and d) where indicated, a referral after ED discharge (i.e., continued AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider).  The Adolescent Perception of SBIRT Services Survey was developed by the research team to evaluate patient experience of SBIRT services. This instrument is being utilized in our current R01 (Mello; R01AA025914).    Secondary Aim 1:  AOD Use:  We will administer a modified Project ASSESS battery to determine AOD use of adolescents at baseline as well as at 3 and 6 months following ED discharge. This battery was administered to nearly 5,000 adolescent ED patients in our Project ASSESS study and modified battery will contain measures of alcohol and drug use (Drug Use Questionnaire).    Secondary Aim 2: Organizational readiness for implementing change:  Organizational Readiness to Implementing Change, is a 12-item scale which will be implemented to all participating staff at four timepoints (baseline, before the Preparation phase, after the Implementation and Sustainability phases) via REDCap. Staff responses to this scale will be used to create an organizational-level measure of each ED's shared perceptions regarding the extent to which their center has the level of skill, training, time, and resources necessary to implement the SBIRT protocol. This measure has been adapted for the proposed study based on the implementation readiness measure developed by Shea and colleagues.  Secondary Aim 3: Linkage to Appropriate Care:  During the 3 and 6 months post discharge follow up, we will administer the Adolescent Perception of Post ED SBIRT Services Survey to patients via REDCap.  We define our outcome as the percent of adolescents receiving an AOD referral who report linkage to discussions about AOD with a health care provider and/or AOD treatment at 3 and 6 months	6 PECARN sites (TBD)	\N	\N	\N	\N	Study start up will occur for the first six months of the study.  The study will run from month 6 through month 54.

Data analysis will occur from month 54 to month 60.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	18	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Utilizing a stepped wedge design, six pediatric EDs will receive the PEDI-SBIRT implementation strategy, which utilizes a computerized brief intervention.  EDs will enroll 1,008 adolescents who screen positive on the NIAAA two-question screen via the PEDI SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey, in order to assess patient-level data post-discharge.  These participants will complete follow up at 1-3 days on the impressions of SBIRT delivery in the ED, 3 months and 6 months post discharge on AOD use. ED nurses and site leaders will be surveyed on organizational readiness for implementation at four time points.	\N	\N	201	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	Primary Aim: We will report descriptive statistics to summarize each element of the SBIRT. Our primary comparison for each of these will be pre- vs. post-intervention among those who screen positive. We will compare rates using site-6-months as the unit of analysis.  Standard stepped-wedge analysis techniques will be used.  Specifically, the site-month rate will be the outcome in a linear model to examine the effect of receiving the PEDI-SBIRT on the rate of completion of each element.  In the model, we will include an effect for each site, as well as an effect for each 6-month period, which will control for temporal trends.  An intervention effect will be included and we will test for a difference between pre- and post-intervention at a 5% significance level.     Secondary Aims:  We will use a similar stepped-wedge analysis to test for a change in AOD use.  In this case, however, the unit of analysis will be the participant, and we will once again include both site and time effects.  We will also perform a similar analysis on the rate of AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider.      In order to explore mediation of ED staff's readiness for organizational change on the effectiveness of PEDI-SBIRT implementation, we will perform the following steps.  First, we will use the model derived in the analysis of the primary aim to create two additional models: (1) a model with ED staff readiness added as a predictor and (2) a model using ED staff readiness to replace adherence rate as the outcome.  Based on the latter model, we will simulate predicted mediator values for each observation under both pre- and post-intervention circumstances.  These predictions will then be used in the first new model to simulate the adherence rate and counterfactual (using ED staff readiness predicted under pre-intervention) corresponding to post-intervention.  The mediation effect is the average of the differences in outcome across all units of analysis.  We will perform repeated simulation to estimate the uncertainty and to test whether the mediation effect is 0.  We will perform sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding.      Power and Sample Size Considerations:   Primary Aim: We plan to enroll at 6 PECARN sites. Based on experience with the ASSESS study, we conservatively anticipate that approximately 4 per month per site will screen positive for alcohol risk, leading to approximately 24 per site per 6-month period.  We believe current rates of adherence to the elements of SBIRT to be near 0. We will conservatively estimate baseline adherence to be 5%.  For the purpose of power calculations, we assume a standard deviation in rates across sites of 8.7%. Based on expected enrollment of 24 per 6 months per site, we will have approximately 80% power to detect a 9.0% difference in adherence rates and 90% power to detect a difference of about 10.8%. Confidence intervals around detection rates in each of the screening strategy groups will be +/- 2-3%.    Change in AOD use:  With approximately 500 participants pre-intervention and 500 post-intervention, we will have 80% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.18 and 90% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.21.  Tanner-Smith and Risser19 (ref) found an effect size (standardized) of about 0.21 for frequency of heavy drinking and 0.14 for quantity of drinking.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	15	There is nothing to disclose.	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	The primary goal of PEDI-SBIRT is to conduct a fully powered Type III hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial and investigate a comprehensive strategy to improve pediatric emergency department (ED) screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for adolescent alcohol use. A secondary aim is to examine patient outcomes of the clinical intervention, in this case, alcohol and other drug use and follow-up treatment services received. Six pediatric EDs will receive the PEDI-SBIRT implementation strategy, expecting to enroll 1,008 adolescents (12- 17 years of age) who screen positive on the NIAAA two-question screen via the PEDI SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey. ED nurses and site leaders will be surveyed on organizational readiness for implementation at four time points. The PI hypothesizes that results of this study will demonstrate that a highly scalable implementation strategy, adapted for the ED setting, will improve the fidelity (i.e., the consistency and quality) of SBIRT delivery in pediatric EDs.	\N	\N	\N	PEDI-SBIRT Implementation Strategy consists of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment:  Screening (S). ED patients age 12-17 years will receive the NIAAA two-question screen (and results recorded in the EMR) during their initial evaluation by nursing staff. A template of the NIAAA two-question screen and clinical informatic technical assistance from Co-I Zonfrillo will be provided to each institution to ease institutional EMR integration.  Parents and others will be asked to leave the room during the alcohol screening (and any other sensitive questions for the adolescent).  Asking the two-question screen in private will establish trust and result in more honest answers. The NIAAA Youth Guide risk estimator will be used to determine adolescents' risk level.  Brief Intervention (BI).  If the teen screens moderate to high risk, the nurse will inform the teen that based on their responses, they will receive a computerized BI.  The nurse will explain that this is an independent activity but will ask for permission to engage parents in a conversation afterwards.  Parent involvement is important in teen BI success and has been linked to better follow through with referral to treatment.  If the teen agrees, the nurses will invite parents back into the room after the computerized intervention, compliment the teen for their honesty and frame his/her wanting to involve the parent positively. Personalized feedback/ referral information will be provided to the teen and parent together.  If teens do not agree, confidentiality will not be violated (unless they are a serious threat to themselves), and personalized feedback/referral information (where appropriate) will only be provided to the teen.  The research team will work with the site leader to design site specific workflows which take into account local and state laws around confidentiality.  This was a successful approach in our past implementation studies, with the majority of teen patients choosing to engage their parent in the conversation.    The nurse assisted computerized BI, e-Check-Up to Go for alcohol (e-CHUG) is designed as a motivational enhancement therapy to motivate teens to reduce their alcohol use.  e-CHUG is divided into three parts: assessment, personalized feedback, and personal reflections. After completing the program, which takes about 25 minutes, the nurse will review personalized feedback which contains information on potential behavior changes based on teen responses, and check in with the adolescent to answer any questions that may have arisen.   Referral to Treatment (RT). Upon discharge, the nurse will provide the personalized feedback form along with the standard discharge instructions.  Based on recommendations from the NIAAA Youth Guide, those screening moderate risk will be referred back to their primary care provider, and those screening high risk will be referred to their medical home and further AOD treatment resources.  These AOD specific instructions will be incorporated into the discharge instructions based on the patient's NIAAA two-question screen results	2	279	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	6	\N	2	\N	Primary Aim: Evaluate the effectiveness of the pediatric ED implementation for SBIRT (PEDI-SBIRT) strategy in increasing the occurrence and fidelity of SBIRT delivery at EDs, relative to usual care.   Hypothesis: ED staff, after receiving the PEDI-SBIRT strategy will increase by 30% the proportion of adolescents receiving each element of the SBIRT protocol as indicated:  a) validated AOD screening, and for those screening positive, b) electronic AOD brief intervention (BI), c) review of printout of change plan from electronic BI by ED nursing staff, and d) where indicated (as defined by NIAAA two question screen guidelines) a referral after ED discharge (i.e., continued AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider).  Secondary Aim 1: Evaluate the effect PEDI-SBIRT has on AOD use at 3 and 6 months following ED discharge. Hypothesis: After the PEDI-SBIRT strategy commences in an ED, adolescents who screen positive on the NIAAA two question screen and receive the electronic BI will report decreased AOD use at both 3 and 6 month follow-ups, compared to adolescents enrolled in the study during the usual care phase.   Secondary Aim 2: Evaluate whether ED staff's readiness for organizational change mediates the influence of the PEDI-SBIRT on implementation effectiveness (i.e., fidelity of SBIRT delivery).   Hypothesis: The effect of the PEDI-SBIRT strategy on implementation effectiveness will be partially mediated by ED staff's measured change in organizational readiness to change.   Secondary Aim 3: Evaluate the effect of PEDI-SBIRT on improving linkage to appropriate care (i.e. continued AOD discussion with primary care provider and/or AOD treatment) following ED discharge.   Hypothesis: Adolescents in EDs that receive the PEDI-SBIRT implementation strategy will report higher rates of AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider within 30 days of discharge, compared to usual care	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	1008	\N	\N

Inclusion is not limited to patients with any specific condition. Patients could have diagnoses of heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, debilitating stroke, multiple diagnoses, or any other life-limiting condition such as frailty.     Patients may not already be enrolled in hospice or currently in an ICU or hospital with no expectation of discharge. Patients who have advance directive documents (e.g., a do not resuscitate order [DNR] or Physicians orders for life sustaining care [POLST]) will not be excluded as these documents do not mean that discussions and planning are finished or static given that options and values may change over time. Family members and care partners will be recruited from those named by patients when the patients are asked if there is a person who is most involved in their health care.	\N	The primary outcomes are a) goal concordant care, that is whether care received corresponds to patient goals, a patient reported outcomes measure and (b) time spent at home Both will be measured at six-months as well 1-year after enrollment. These will be measured at the patient level and compared across the two models, but can also be compared at the cluster level. Several secondary outcomes will be included as well. Common measures are being coordinated across the advance care planning and community palliative care projects funded by PCORI in order to allow comparisons across projects as appropriate.	Primary care practices will be recruited by seven primary care PBRNs that provide care to approximately three million patients in five U.S. states (OR, WI, CO, IA, NC) and two Canadian provinces (QB, ON) from practices that are members of these networks. The PBRNs all have experience in recruiting practices for participation in research and supporting patient identification and enrollment. Each of the seven PBRNs will recruit 6-8 practices (42-56 practices) and 170 participants (1,190 participants) will be recruited from each PBRN.	\N	\N	\N	\N	18 months to complete enrollment and 24 months of follow-up, for a total of 42 months	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	11	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	We will conduct a multicenter cluster randomized trial comparing two models for implementing SICP.

Units of randomization will be enrolled primary care practices from across seven geographically diverse practice-based research networks (PBRNs) that are part of the Meta-network Learning And Research Center (Meta-LARC). Each participating PBRN will recruit practices to reach the goal of 160 eligible and enrolled patients who complete followup across all the participating practices for each PBRN. Practices will be randomized to SICP arm. Multilevel modeling will be used to account for the hierarchical structure of the data. The trial will comply with CONSORT guidelines adapted for reporting cluster randomized trials.	\N	\N	206	\N	\N	35	\N	\N	We will perform a descriptive analysis of practice, clinician, and patient characteristics to assure comparability of the two study arms and we will include potentially confounding variables as covariates in analyses. Multilevel modeling will be used to account for the hierarchical structure of the data. We will specify random effects at the practice (cluster) level and, when comparing baseline to follow-up, at the respondent level. For each outcome, we will assess goodness of fit and model assumptions. For binary outcomes, we will use either the mean proportions from logistic regression or risk-difference regression to estimate the difference between arms. For days at home, we will evaluate Poisson or negative binomial models for fit and include days observed as an offset, or rate denominator.    Primary analyses will be conducted under an intention to treat assumption, and thus missing data will be multiple imputed using baseline measurements and standard tools. Because missingness may be informative in this study, we also plan to evaluate potential bias with (1) a worst-case sensitivity analysis, in which the 'worst' outcome is substituted for missing outcomes, and (2) a Heckman selection model,31 in which we will model the probability of having non-missing outcome data using available information, then test the correlation between the residuals of that model and the residuals in our main outcome model. A non-zero correlation indicates the presence of bias. This approach will also allow us to compare bias-corrected with uncorrected estimates of treatment effects.    We will test for significant heterogeneity of effects in subgroups defined by practice and patient characteristics, including location in the U.S. vs. Canada or in urban vs. rural environments, number of clinic providers/FTE, and clinical or diagnostic subgroups (e.g., cancer, advanced chronic conditions, frailty/advanced age, and dementia). We will include interaction terms for these groups (model * characteristic) in our models; rejection of the null hypothesis that the interaction is equal to zero or a large estimated effect will be considered evidence of subgroup difference.     After we have collected six-month outcomes on 408 participants (12 per cluster), we will conduct an interim analysis to determine whether to stop. Specifically, we will perform a one-sided test at α=0.05 against a null hypothesis that the proportion of patients in both arms combined reporting goal-concordant care is 0.15. Because we will not be comparing the two approaches, we not need to un-blind the statisticians or adjust significance levels of primary analyses for multiple comparisons. Our effective sample size at this point will be 408/DE = 263, where DE = 1 + (m-1)ρ = 1 + (12-1)(0.05), and to reject the null with 90% power, our observed proportion will need to be 0.22 or higher. We choose these cutoff proportions because failure to reject the null would mean that (a) neither arm is performing meaningful ACP, or (b) one arm is outperforming the other dramatically, e.g. 0.10 in one arm and 0.34 in the other, which average to 0.22. While not expected, either of these cases provides justification for stopping.	\N	\N	\N	Canada	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	11	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Overview:  The study is designed to promote serious illness care planning so that patients with advanced illnesses and limited life expectancies can spend more time at home and receive care concordant with their goals.   Objectives:  The objective is to determine if it is more effective to focus Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) implementation on a model where a single primary care clinician is responsible for the conversation and planning, given the nature of the patient-clinician relationship, or use a team-based model, given the time and resource constraint on clinicians. The aims are to:  1. Assess the comparative effectiveness in primary care of team-based SICP vs. primary care clinician-focused SICP on concordance of care with patient goals and time spent at home (primary outcomes) and secondary outcomes (e.g., anxiety, depression, quality of life).  2. Explore contextual factors influencing the implementation of the two different models of SICP and how these vary across the primary care practices, with a focus on the comparison of practices in the U.S. and Canada and on practice-level characteristics (e.g., size, rural/urban, affiliation with an integrated health system, prior advance care planning activities, PCP staff disciplines and training)	\N	\N	\N	Arm 1: Clinician-focused ACP model  The clinician-focused model will center serious illness care planning on the conversations between a single primary care clinician (physicians, NPs, PAs) and the patient and family. In this model, the primary care clinician who is knowledgeable about the patient provides individualized assessment and care. The clinician will receive SICP training and utilize SICP tools to have serious illness care conversations and help them plan. Training will include how to identify appropriate patients, skills for initial and follow-up serious illness conversations, and how to document the conversation and planning in the medical record. Serious illness care planning benefits from individualized assessment and care from a clinician who knows the patient and has medical expertise; this is emphasized in the clinician-focused model.     Arm 2: Team-based ACP model  The team-based model will also draw on the medical expertise of the clinician; however, the team identified by the practice will receive training and use SICP tools. Team members will share care planning tasks appropriate to their scope of practice and coordinate communication and follow-up across the team consisting of the primary care clinician and at least one other person from a different profession or practice role (e.g., nurses, care managers, social workers, medical assistants, chaplains, peer counselors, community health workers etc.). Training will include how to divide the tasks and work together as a team in addition to the SICP-specific training provided in the clinician-focused arm. In this model, non-primary care clinician team members become involved in conversations with the patient, family, and care partners. The team-based approach focuses on the importance of having time and ability to address the holistic range of patient and family concerns in serious illness care planning.	1	300	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	18	7	\N	2	\N	Our objective is to determine if it is more effective to focus SICP implementation on a model where a single primary care clinician is responsible for the conversation and planning, given the nature of the patient-clinician relationship, or use a team-based model, given the time and resource constraint on clinicians.

At that time, the objectives of the study, as well as the risks and benefits of enrolling, will be explained in detail to potential subjects.	\N	The primary clinical endpoint for this study is the neoplastic progression rate, defined as the occurrence of high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/mucosal EAC/invasive EAC at any time during the study period following enrollment. Secondary clinical endpoints include progression rates to invasive EAC alone, complete eradication rates for both BE and dysplasia, adverse events and recurrence rates. PROs defined through the Engagement Initiative during the U34 timeframe and endorsed by the Study Advisory Group (SAG) will be included as critical endpoints in this study.  PROs will likely include: burden of intervention (number of endoscopies, number of clinic visits, pain/discomfort related to the intervention), change in QOL scores (using PROMIS Global and SF-12 scales), level of anxiety and depression among patients and caregivers [Worry of Cancer Scale (WOCS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)] and lost productivity for patients and caregivers.	The PIs have conducted several important NIH and GI society-funded studies in the field of BE and BE-related neoplasia that have broadly impacted clinical practice worldwide. This includes the first randomized controlled trial demonstrating the efficacy of ablation in BE patients with dysplasia, several studies describing the effectiveness and safety of EET and establishing Quality Indicators for EET for BE-related neoplasia patients. The PIs have first-authored GI society guidelines for the management of patients with BE and EET for patients with BE-related neoplasia. The PIs have a strong working relationship and have developed a robust platform for the design and conduct of high-impact multicenter RCTs, on budget and on time.    The PIs have assembled a network of collaborators who are world leaders in BE.  Included centers have demonstrated a strong research interest in BE and published impactful studies in this field.     Potential collaborating sites:  University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado  University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina  Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois  University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California  Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio  Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, Minnesota  Kaiser Permanente, San Francisco, San Francisco, California  Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio  Columbia University, New York, New York  University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Charleston, South Carolina  Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida  Veterans Affairs Medical Center, White River Junction, Vermont  Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri  Geisinger Health Care System, Danville, Pennsylvania  University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan  University of Washington, Seattle, Washington  Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland  Gastrointestinal Associates, Knoxville, Tennessee     All these centers have the clinical experience and are high-volume centers for management of BE-related neoplasia patients. In addition, each center has established clinical research resources that will be augmented during the U34 funding period to the level necessary to conduct this study to the highest methodologic and regulatory standards. All site investigators have expressed interest in participating in this landmark randomized controlled trial.    Description of experience of collaborating sites in successfully conducting clinical studies  The proposed collaborating sites have demonstrated the capacity and infrastructure to work effectively and efficiently together in conducting multicenter clinical trials of the highest quality in the field of BE. Over 50% of the sites participated in the seminal trial demonstrating the efficacy if this method in patients with BE and HGD published in NEJM in 2009, demonstrating their ability to work collaboratively to produce high quality endoscopic research. All collaborating sites and site PIs have high-volume BE and EAC units with proven track records in endoscopy research. All these sites will have the appropriate study population to be able to contribute an adequate number of subjects to the study to meet the enrollment target of 6-8 subjects/month.	\N	\N	\N	\N	5 years	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	We intend to propose a multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial of EET versus endoscopic surveillance for patients with BE and LGD.       Eligible patients will undergo centralized randomization with a 1:1 allocation ratio to one of these two arms. The randomization sequence will be generated centrally at the Data Coordinating Center. In order to maximize generalizability, a pragmatic study design has been adopted which focuses on only one protocol-driven intervention - randomization to EET or surveillance. All subsequent relevant clinical decisions are deferred to treating physicians as per usual care. However, to ensure a consistency in level of care across practices, a set of best practices espoused in the recent American Gastroenterological Association document to guide diagnosis and management of LGD will be disseminated across all sites.     In addition, this research initiative will also include a prospective cohort study in which patients with BE and LGD who decline randomization in the randomized controlled trial but undergo EET or endoscopic surveillance, and are willing to participate, will be followed longitudinally. While the cohort group will not directly inform the primary outcome, they will contribute to the biorepository and aid in identification of factors associated with neoplastic progression and response to therapy.    We will define PROs that will serve as critical endpoints in the RCT and cohort study. This approach will integrate multiple data collection methods from varied stakeholders to develop relevant concepts and define and validate instruments. A SAG will be established and will include representatives from the following groups: patients and caregivers, endoscopists, cardiothoracic/GI oncology surgeons and oncologists, health administrators, policymakers, industry and patient advocacy groups. Patients and caregivers will be identified using on-line support groups. These individuals will be actively engaged via surveys, interviews and focus groups. The overarching objective is to determine which management approach is better as defined by both traditional clinical endpoints and robust PRO measures. The planning phase will also include a pilot study at select participating centers to assess patient willingness to participate and undergo randomization which will demonstrate feasibility and also help us determine our sample size calculation.	\N	\N	92	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be utilized. The time to progression will be calculated from the time of randomization (RCT)/enrollment (COHORT) until the endoscopy date on which HGD/mucosal EAC/invasive EAC is detected. The proportional event rates during follow-up will be compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. Risk differences will be calculated as the differences in proportional event rates during follow-up. Number needed to treat (NNT) will be calculated as 1 divided by the risk difference. For all pre-specified analyses, a final two-sided p<0.05 will indicate statistical significance. Fisher's exact test or chi-squared test will be used to assess differences between the two groups for analysis of the primary endpoint of proportion of patients with neoplastic progression. Categorical variables will be compared using the Fisher exact test and continuous variables will be compared using the t-test (normal distribution) or Mann-Whitney test (skewed distribution). A subgroup analysis will be conducted to identify risk factors of progression and absence of LGD during follow-up using logistic regression analyses. Baseline variables (demographics, BE length, presence of visible lesions, confirmed LGD, multifocal LGD, and center differences) will be identified with a forward stepwise selection strategy using the likelihood ratio statistic, with a p value <0.10 as the criterion level for selection. No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons. Adverse events will be categorized using MedDRA classification, and described using the categorical analysis described above. Logistic regression analysis will be performed to assess risk factors for common adverse events, including esophageal strictures. The analytic plan will be adjusted for all PROs defined during the Engagement Approach and planning phase. All exploratory analyses will be interpreted more conservatively using a significance level of 0.01.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	No conflicts of interest	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The safety of endoscopic eradication therapy has been well defined in multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Similarly, the safety of surveillance endoscopy with biopsies is well-established. Perhaps the most serious concern is the risk of progression to invasive cancer in patients enrolled in the surveillance arm. However, available data clearly demonstrate that endoscopic surveillance usually detects progression to HGD/EAC at a stage amenable to EET, and rarely requires esophagectomy. Our Safety Analysis Plan and robust monitoring apparatus will ensure rigorous capture of adverse event data and thus allowing an unbiased appraisal of risks associated with these procedures.	1	360	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	19	\N	\N	\N	Primary Objective(s):   We propose to conduct a multicenter, randomized controlled pragmatic trial of endoscopic surveillance versus EET in patients with BE and LGD. This study will directly inform an important, everyday treatment decision faced by patients, caregivers and their clinicians.   Our specific aims include: (i) To compare the effectiveness of two established approaches for the management of patients with BE with LGD, endoscopic surveillance and EET, using accepted clinical endpoints (neoplastic progression rates, adverse events and recurrence rates). Hypothesis: patients undergoing EET will demonstrate less neoplastic progression and EAC than those undergoing endoscopic surveillance.    Secondary Objective(s):   (i)To compare PROs, as defined and prioritized by patients, caregivers, clinicians and other key stakeholders, in patients with BE and LGD treated with EET or undergoing surveillance. Hypothesis: patients treated with EET will experience increased psychological well-being and improved quality of life (QOL) despite added procedural risks and healthcare encounters compared to the surveillance arm. (ii) To establish a tissue repository of patients with LGD that includes esophageal biopsy specimens, blood and saliva with the goal of identifying biomarkers associated with the highest risk of progression in this patient population. Hypothesis: biomarkers can assist in risk-stratification of patients with BE with LGD.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	200	\N	\N

Our specific goals will be to deliver, monitor, and record usual pain care including opioid and other analgesic use; assess patients for study-determined characteristics including detailed patient reported outcomes (historical data such as previous surgeries, trauma, substance abuse, concurrent pain conditions, depression, somatization tendencies, support system, etc); and to perform brain imaging, sensory tests, and collect biospecimens at onset of acute pain and follow-up (time = 0, 3 months, and 6 months). The goal as MCC is to implement the enrollment and multimodal longitudinal assessment of a large cohort of patients with acute pain from a musculoskeletal trauma to identify candidate biomarkers and combine them into biosignatures predictive of the susceptibility or resilience to the development of chronic pain.   As one of two MCCs, our work will be coordinated with NIH-determined Omics Data Generation Centers (ODGCs), a Data Integration Resource Center (DIRC), and a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) into an overall A2CPS program. Centers will work together as a consortium with strong communication and cooperation.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1800	\N	\N

This is a dynamic interval of pubertal growth during which gene expression is changing spontaneously, body weight can increase by as much as 40%, and growth factors like IGF-1 double. The physical fitness phenotype in the cohort will be measured yearly with cutting-edge cardiopulmonary exercise testing, body composition by DXA, habitual physical activity, and circulating biomarkers of growth, metabolism, and inflammation. These data will be linked with RNAseq derived transcriptomics of monocyte exercise-responsiveness using systems and network-based bioinformatics and statistics. The effect of acute exercise on monocyte subtypes will be measured with flow cytometry. A newly developed vascularized micro-organ platform permits unprecedented visualization and quantification of how monocytes obtained from study participants interact with an in vitro endothelial cell system. Noninvasive ultrasound-based measures that have been validated in children will detect the earliest signs of vascular dysfunction such as carotid intima media thickness and distensibility.    PROJECT 2. Exercise Associated Natural Killer Cell Transcriptomics in Pediatric Survivors of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia: Mechanisms of Enhancing Health    We will test our hypotheses by tracking a cohort of children recruited at Tanner 2-3 (roughly 10-14 y.o.) over a 3-4 year period, through Tanner 5. This is a dynamic interval of pubertal growth during which gene expression is changing spontaneously, body weight can increase by as much as 40%, and growth factors like IGF-1 double. The physical fitness phenotype in the ALL survivors will be measured yearly with cutting-edge cardiopulmonary exercise testing, body composition by DXA, habitual physical activity, and circulating biomarkers of growth, metabolism, and inflammation. These data will be linked with RNAseq derived transcriptomics of NK cell exercise-responsiveness using systems and network-based informatics and statistics. Key NK cell subsets and function will be measured with flow cytometry.    PROJECT 3.

Physical Fitness, Body Composition, Pubertal Status, and Habitual Physical Activity. Preliminary Data and Approach: CPET and Exercise Challenge. The paradigm that we developed over the years consists of two acute exercise tests. The child first performs CPET using a ramp type of progressive exercise. The fitness data from the initial test then is used to calculate the work rate for the 10x2 test. The work rate we use is approximately 50% of the difference between the participant's lactate threshold and peak V?O2 (approximately 80% of peak effort). In this way, the work rate is scaled to the child's capability, is sufficiently large to reveal rapidly responsive biomarkers from blood or saliva, and will permit us to compare responses among children and adults of different sizes.    �Body Composition. We have used DXA in pediatric research studies since 2002 to measure lean body mass, bone mineralization, and adiposity (90). Several thousand research DXAs have been successfully performed, including over thousand children and adolescents and approximately 300 infants, leading to a number of research publications (91,92). In a comparison of DXA and MRI, Bridge and coworkers (93) followed a group of 8-11 year old boys and girls and repeated the studies 26-48 months later. They concluded, 'this study validates the common use of DXA in monitoring change in body composition and supports ongoing use in this role in both clinical and research studies.'    �Habitual Physical Activity (HPA). Accelerometry is emerging as a reliable technology for measuring HPA, sedentary behavior, and sleep with improving validity in children (94-98), even compared with more expensive measurements of total energy expenditure such as doubly-labelled water (99-105). Our Consultant Dr. Stewart Trost is an internationally recognized leader in the science of assessing HPA in children (97,98,106). There is increasing evidence for the hypothesis that sedentary behavior independently increases cardiovascular disease risk in children and adults (107-113). Since HPA is only weakly to moderately correlated to physical fitness in children and adolescents and may prove to modulate exercise molecular mechanisms distinctly from aerobic fitness (114), we propose to measure HPA. We have experience using accelerometers and HR monitors in our ongoing training studies, in particular to determine the impact of participation in a chronic exercise training on HPA in adolescents. We use the triaxial accelerometer, the Actigraph GT3X, to assess HPA. As a physical activity assessment device, it has extensive validity and reliability support within the scientific literature, and is used across the globe in large-scale clinical trials as well as smaller-scale research projects involving both children and adults (103-105,115-117).    �Assessment of Pubertal Status. Accurate assessment of maturational status is essential. Physical examination by trained pediatric endocrinologists remains the most reliable way to measure pubertal status (Tanner stage). As noted by Rasmussen et al. (118) in a study of 898 children (418 girls, 480 boys, age 7.4-14.9) and 1173 parents, 'Pubertal assessment by the child or the parents is not a reliable measure of exact pubertal staging and should be augmented by a physical examination.' One of two senior physicians in UCI Department of Pediatrics, Board Certified in Pediatric Endocrinology, will conduct the Tanner staging physical examination. This service will be provided to this research as part of the academic service that is a key requirement of membership in the Department.	2	83	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	4	\N	1	\N	The long-term goal of our translational research group is to transform how exercise is used to benefit child health. Using the unique synergy that only the PPG mechanism can provide, we propose to explore in novel ways the interrelated molecular mechanisms through which exercise and physical activity influence innate immune cells and ultimately mediate clinical outcomes in diseases and conditions of critical health impact in children and adolescents. We have designed the study to prospectively examine the changes that occur in innate immune cell genomic and functional responses to exercise over a critical period of growth and development. The PPG Specific Aims are:    1.               To examine the impact of exercise on innate immune cell genomics and function in key areas of child health.    a.   In Project 1 we investigate how exercise in healthy children can 'reprogram' monocytes into repair and patrolling cells that ameliorate vascular injury and prevent childhood origins of adult atherosclerosis.    b.   In Project 2 we investigate how exercise in child and adolescent survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia can alter circulating natural killer (NK) cells and mitigate the increased risk of obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, and malignant relapse known to occur in many of these childhood survivors.    c.   In Project 3 we investigate how exercise can alter genomics mechanisms in neutrophils to benefit health in children with cystic fibrosis, a disease marked by chronic pulmonary infection and inflammation, and in whom neutrophil function is altered and physical fitness is associated with improved quality of life and survival (4).    2.               To create a common administrative structure that will oversee and ensure economies of scale in study coordination, study design, statistical analysis, and data management, and ensure best practices in scientific rigor and reproducibility.    3.               To incorporate into the PPG the existing experience and core infrastructure of PERC (UC Irvine's unique Pediatric Exercise and Genomic Research Center) in the conduct of exercise testing and quality control of transcriptomic, flow cytometry, and biomarker analysis required for the individual projects.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	120	\N	\N

\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	Not provided	We will enroll adults 40-75 years of age, the age of most individuals with type 2 diabetes or pre diabetes. Subjects with diabetes will be only on diet therapy or oral agents that are non-hypoglycemic (i.e. no sulfonylrueas or glenides). This will limit the chances of hypoglycemia if, as hypothesized, they become more insulin sensitive with iron reduction.	27	Inclusion criteria will be ages 40-75, with a hemoglobin A1c values within three months or at enrollment of 5.7-6.5% (pre diabetes) or <9% with a diagnosis of diabetes. (That cut off will decrease the likelihood of major changes in intervention during the trial period). Subjects with diabetes will be taking non hypoglycemic oral agents (metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, acarbose, DPP4 inhibitors) only, and not insulin, sulfonylureas, or glinides.  Exclusion criteria will be: anemia or recent blood loss (GI bleed or major surgery within 12 months, sickle cell disease, blood donation within 6 months); bleeding diatheses (coagulation abnormalities or treatment with anticoagulants); serious chronic infections (hepatitis B or C, HIV) or chronic inflammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue diseases) that could elevate ferritin as an 'acute phase reactant'; active cancer diagnosis (excluding skin cell cancers other than melanoma); renal insufficiency (e GFR<60 ml/min); history of orthostatic hypotension.	\N	The primary endpoint will be an improvement in glycemia (fasting blood glucose or HbA1c). We realize that fasting glucose is highly variable, and in a parallel mechanistic trial will hope to examine more complex and dynamic indices including oral and intravenous glucose tolerance testing, but as a pragmatic trial we are maintaining simplicity through the use of fasting glucose. We also realize that HbA1c will be affected by blood donation and therefore will use that value only if determined > 3 months after the most recent phlebotomy and have designed the trial to maximize this possibility. Our hypothesis is that blood donation will improve both of these indices as demonstrated in our pilot and other small clinical studies.    Secondary endpoints will include improvement in insulin sensitivity (decreased HOMA-IR), discontinuation of oral anti diabetic agents because of improved HbA1c, and improvement in serum aminotransferases. We are including the latter determinations because they are inexpensive and frequently assessed as part of usual clinical care, and because of the literature suggesting that they are also improved by phlebotomy. However, because we are not screening for NASH per se, which requires more expensive phenotyping, these are a secondary endpoint only.	This trial will be performed as a collaboration between three CTSA sites, UNC Chapel Hill, Wake Forest, and Duke. 3	\N	\N	\N	\N	Not provided	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	15	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	We are proposing a pragmatic clinical trial to determine the efficacy of implementing an iron reduction strategy in an outpatient clinical setting on indices of type 2 diabetes and NASH. A proposal to conduct a separate mechanistic trial with more intense documentation of glycemic status (frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testing) and NASH (MRI, Fibroscan and other serum markers) is under review at the NIH; that trial includes sham (blindfolded) phlebotomy. The proposed trial, in contrast, will involve little testing beyond what would be done in the course of normal clinical care, and only require fasting blood draws.    The steps in the trial will be:    Assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria by history and chart review.  Determination of serum ferritin, and if in the upper half of the normal range, additional blood work if necessary (fasting glucose and insulin, and if not determined with 3 months, HbA1c, hemoglobin and serum aminotransferase levels, and randomization to observation or phlebotomy.  Phlebotomy will be achieved at either the Red Cross, the Hospital blood banks at the participating centers, or their Clinical Research Units. 4-6 weeks after each phlebotomy, ferritin and the need for further phlebotomy will be reassessed if the target has not been achieved. Each phlebotomy will be of 1 Unit (500mL), with hemoglobin assessed before each procedure, and orthostatic hypotension assessed before and after. A calorie free rehydration drink will be offered each subject before the phlebotomy to minimize the low (<0.02%) risk of fainting.  Three months after attaining target ferritin, or within 9 months of enrollment, fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and serum aminotransferase levels will be reassessed. HbA1c will be used in the data analysis only if drawn at least 3 months after the most recent phlebotomy.	\N	\N	660	\N	\N	156	\N	\N	The primary outcomes will be assessed by comparing changes values at enrollment and end of the trial, between the phlebotomy and observation groups. Sample size was calculated from the effect size of donating a single unit of blood on fasting glucose and HbA1c in a European study, which is a likely underestimate of the effect size that we will observe in this trial with its greater degree of iron lowering and longer observation period. With a power of 0.80 we can detect an effect at p<0.05 with 59 subjects in each group. We are recruiting to allow a dropout rate of 33% and still achieve that power.    Secondary analysis will include assessing changes in the primary variable as a function of the degree of lowering of ferritin. Results will be stratified for weight, age, and gender as other variables that might affect response.	\N	\N	\N	\N	6	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	46	None.	\N	\N	\N	\N	This trial will be performed as a collaboration between three CTSA sites, UNC Chapel Hill, Wake Forest, and Duke. The Directors of two of the CTSA programs (McClain, Wake Forest and Buse, UNC) and two of their Endocrinology Sections (Buse, UNC and D'alessia, Duke) at the three institutions are co-Investigators in this trial. Preliminary analysis at the Wake Forest clinics showed that by chart review there were 3,350 subjects fitting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and of those half will have ferretin levels in the upper half of normal. Recruitment will proceed with the assistance of the Recruitment Centers of each CTSA. This is a common disease and a safe and minimally disruptive intervention, so we do not anticipate problems with recruitment. Recruitment will occur over a period of six months, and procedures and data collection will be completed 9 months after that.	The goal of this project is to reduce the amount of iron by phlebotomy to:  Aim 1 determine the effects of iron reduction on glycemia in individuals with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or early type 2 diabetes   Aim 2 determine if there are changes associated with iron reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase (index of steatohepatitis), insulin sensitivity by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), weight, blood pressure, changes in the number of diabetes medications for participants with diabetes or in glycemic status (normal, prediabetes or diabetes) for participants with prediabetes.	\N	\N	\N	The intervention is blood donation sufficient to reduce serum ferritin from the upper half of normal to the lower quartile of normal.

Glycemic control will be assessed by fasting glucose, homeostasis model of insulin resistance calculated from fasting glucose and insulin, and HbA1c before and after treatment. The primary outcomes will be assessed 3 months after achieving the target ferritin, and no longer than 9 months after initiating phlebotomy.     2.

In addition to seeking consent for a standard, gross autopsy for the subject from the next-of-kin, a molecular autopsy will also be discussed.  In those cases where a molecular autopsy is granted, a blood sample from the deceased, and potentially a small cardiac biopsy, will be acquired for genetic testing. Biologically related family members would also be asked to provide a sample (saliva or buccal swab) for genetic testing.  For family members the rank order of preference is as follows: 1) parents, 2) siblings, and 3) offspring.  Although a biologic specimen from living, biologically related family members may be acquired; those samples will only be used for genetic testing as control and confirmatory analysis and testing dictates. Parents will be sequenced in the case of a trio, though results will only be returned as pertinent to the deceased.        A complete autopsy report must be provided at a minimum. In order to refine the subject's phenotype as concisely as possible pertinent data obtained in the immediate pre-mortem period, such as ECGs should be obtained if possible.      The samples from the deceased and some living family members will be processed and exome sequenced at STSI in most cases.  The initial analysis efforts will be focused on known genes that have been shown to be causal for sudden unexpected cardiac death (ion channels, cardiac structural proteins, etc). Further analysis leveraging family information (i.e. parents) will be utilized to identify de-novo variants that may be causal for sudden death - especially in infant cases. CTSA sites with the desire and capability to perform their own sequencing and analysis may do so and contribute to the genetic database described below.      A report of genetic findings will be generated and returned to the medical examiner. With proper consent from next-of-kin, any insights into potential causal gene variants will be communicated to the index subject's biological relatives who have consented to receive information.  This will be done via  study staff having experience in returning genetic results to a physician selected by the living family members.      All sequence and phenotype data will be organized and stored on shared computational resource which allows for statistical association of genetic variants with sudden death, as well as browsing by external users by phenotype and/or genotype data in order to identify the number of individuals with/without particular genetic variants and/or particular phenotypes. No individual level data will be accessible through this portal. This database will allow for the continuous analysis and identification of novel causes of sudden death as well as aid in the interpretation of this and other genetic studies.	\N	\N	634	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sequencing and identification of pathogenic variants utilizes the workflow described in Bloss CS et al.

Study population includes all ED nurses, site leaders and adolescent ED patients (12-17 years screening positive on the NIAAA two-question alcohol screen survey) from participating institutions. ED patients will be screened using the PEDI-SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey (containing the NIAAA two-question screen). Those patients screening negative on the screen will not be included; their results will be discharged and not analyzed.	155	Staff:  All ED nurses and identified site leaders from participating institutions will be included.    Adolescent patients: Exclusion criteria will be kept to a minimum:  a) between the ages of 12-17 years; b) treated in one of the participating EDs; c) screened positive for AOD use based on PEDI SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey; d) fluent in English or Spanish; and e) able to provide written assent and parent able to provide written consent.  Exclusion criteria include: in police custody, being evaluated by child protective services, in state custody, ED visit for suicide attempt and any acute conditions that would preclude provision of informed consent (i.e., acute psychosis, altered mental status, cognitive impairment).	\N	Primary Aim: Implementation Effectiveness: During the 1-3-day follow up, we will administer the Adolescent Perception of SBIRT Services Survey to enrolled patients via REDCap. Using the NIAAA two-question screen Risk Algorithm, we will calculate site-specific rates for: a) use of NIAAA two-questions screening, and for those screening positive, b) computerized AOD brief intervention (BI), c) review of personalized feedback from computerized BI by ED nursing staff, and d) where indicated, a referral after ED discharge (i.e., continued AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider). The Adolescent Perception of SBIRT Services Survey was developed by the research team to evaluate patient  experience of SBIRT services. This instrument is being utilized in our current R01 (Mello; R01AA025914).   Secondary Aim 1: AOD Use: We will administer a modified Project ASSESS battery to determine AOD use of adolescents at baseline as well as at 3 and 6 months following ED discharge. This battery was administered to nearly 5,000  adolescent ED patients in our Project ASSESS study and modified battery will contain measures of alcohol and drug use (Drug Use Questionnaire).   Secondary Aim 2: Organizational readiness for implementing change: Organizational Readiness to Implementing Change, is a 12-item scale which will be implemented to all participating staff at four timepoints (baseline, before the  Preparation phase, after the Implementation and Sustainability phases) via REDCap. Staff responses to this scale will be used to create an organizational-level measure of each ED's shared perceptions regarding the extent to which their center has the level of skill, training, time, and resources necessary to implement the SBIRT protocol. This measure has been adapted for the proposed study based on the implementation readiness measure developed by Shea and colleagues.  Secondary Aim 3: Linkage to Appropriate Care: During the 3 and 6 months post discharge follow up, we will administer the Adolescent Perception of Post ED SBIRT Services Survey to patients via REDCap. We define our outcome as the  percent of adolescents receiving an AOD referral who report linkage to discussions about AOD with a health care provider and/or AOD treatment at 3 and 6 months.	6 Injury Free Coalition for Kids sites within the United States ( sites TBD)	\N	\N	\N	\N	Study start up will occur for the first six months of the study.

Data analysis will occur from month 54 to month 60.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Utilizing a stepped wedge design, six pediatric EDs will receive the PEDI-SBIRT implementation strategy, which utilizes a computerized brief intervention. EDs will enroll 1,008 adolescents who screen positive on the NIAAA two-question screen via the PEDI SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey, in order to assess patient-level data post-discharge. These participants will complete follow up at 1-3 days on the impressions of SBIRT delivery in the ED, 3 months and 6 months post discharge on AOD use. ED nurses and site leaders will be surveyed on organizational readiness for implementation at four time points.	\N	\N	199	\N	\N	16	\N	\N	Primary Aim: We will report descriptive statistics to summarize each element of the SBIRT. Our primary comparison for each of these will be pre- vs. post-intervention among those who screen positive. We will compare rates using  site-6-months as the unit of analysis. Standard stepped-wedge analysis techniques will be used. Specifically, the site-month rate will be the outcome in a linear model to examine the effect of receiving the PEDI-SBIRT on the rate of  completion of each element. In the model, we will include an effect for each site, as well as an effect for each 6-month period, which will control for temporal trends. An intervention effect will be included and we will test for a difference  between pre- and post-intervention at a 5% significance level.   Secondary Aims: We will use a similar stepped-wedge analysis to test for a change in AOD use. In this case, however, the unit of analysis will be the participant, and we will once again include both site and time effects. We will  also perform a similar analysis on the rate of AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider.  In order to explore mediation of ED staff's readiness for organizational change on the effectiveness of PEDI-SBIRT implementation, we will perform the following steps. First, we will use the model derived in the analysis of the primary aim to create two additional models: (1) a model with ED staff readiness added as a predictor and (2) a model using ED staff readiness to replace adherence rate as the outcome. Based on the latter model, we will simulate predicted mediator  values for each observation under both pre- and post-intervention circumstances. These predictions will then be used in the first new model to simulate the adherence rate and counterfactual (using ED staff readiness predicted under pre-intervention) corresponding to post-intervention. The mediation effect is the average of the differences in outcome across all units of analysis. We will perform repeated simulation to estimate the uncertainty and to test whether the mediation effect is 0. We will perform sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding.  Power and Sample Size Considerations:  Primary Aim: We plan to enroll at 6 Injury Free Coalition for Kids sites. Based on experience with the ASSESS study, we conservatively anticipate that approximately 4 per month per site will screen positive for alcohol risk, leading to approximately 24 per site per 6-month period. We believe current rates of adherence to the elements of SBIRT to be near 0. We will conservatively estimate baseline adherence to be 5%. For the purpose of power calculations, we assume a standard deviation in rates  across sites of 8.7%. Based on expected enrollment of 24 per 6 months per site, we will have approximately 80% power to detect a 9.0% difference in adherence rates and 90% power to detect a difference of about 10.8%. Confidence intervals around detection rates in each of the screening strategy groups will be +/- 2-3%. Change in AOD use: With approximately 500 participants pre-intervention and 500 post-intervention, we will have 80% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.18 and 90% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.21. Tanner-Smith and Risser19 (ref) found an effect size (standardized) of about 0.21 for frequency of heavy drinking and 0.14 for quantity of drinking.	\N	\N	\N	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	Nothing to disclose.	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	The primary goal of PEDI-SBIRT is to conduct a fully powered Type III hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial and investigate a comprehensive strategy to improve pediatric emergency department (ED) screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for adolescent alcohol use. A secondary aim is to examine patient outcomes of the clinical intervention, in this case, alcohol and other drug use and follow-up treatment services received. Six pediatric EDs will receive the PEDI-SBIRT implementation strategy, expecting to enroll 1,008 adolescents (12- 17 years of age) who screen positive on the NIAAA two-question screen via the PEDI SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey. ED nurses and site leaders will be surveyed on organizational readiness for implementation at four time points. The PI hypothesizes that results of this study will demonstrate that a highly scalable implementation strategy, adapted for the ED setting, will improve the fidelity (i.e., the consistency and quality) of SBIRT delivery in pediatric EDs.	\N	\N	\N	PEDI-SBIRT Implementation Strategy consists of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment:  Screening (S). ED patients age 12-17 years will receive the NIAAA two-question screen (and results recorded in the EMR) during their initial evaluation by nursing staff. A template of the NIAAA two-question screen and clinical informatics technical assistance from Co-I Zonfrillo will be provided to each institution to ease institutional EMR integration. Parents and others will be asked to leave the room during the alcohol screening (and any other sensitive questions for the  adolescent). Asking the two-question screen in private will establish trust and result in more honest answers. The NIAAA Youth Guide risk estimator will be used to determine adolescents' risk level.   Brief Intervention (BI). If the teen screens moderate to high risk, the nurse will inform the teen that based on their responses, they will receive a computerized BI. The nurse will explain that this is an independent activity but will ask for  permission to engage parents in a conversation afterwards. Parent involvement is important in teen BI success and has been linked to better follow through with referral to treatment. If the teen agrees, the nurses will invite parents back into  the room after the computerized intervention, compliment the teen for their honesty and frame his/her wanting to involve the parent positively. Personalized feedback/ referral information will be provided to the teen and parent together.   If teens do not agree, confidentiality will not be violated (unless they are a serious threat to themselves), and personalized feedback/referral information (where appropriate) will only be provided to the teen. The research team will work with the site leader to design site specific workflows which take into account local and state laws around confidentiality. This was a successful approach in our past implementation studies, with the majority of teen patients choosing to engage their parent in the conversation.  The nurse assisted computerized BI, e-Check-Up to Go for alcohol (e-CHUG) is designed as a motivational enhancement therapy to motivate teens to reduce their alcohol use. e-CHUG is divided into three parts: assessment, personalized  feedback, and personal reflections. After completing the program, which takes about 25 minutes, the nurse will review personalized feedback which contains information on potential behavior changes based on teen responses, and check  in with the adolescent to answer any questions that may have arisen.    Referral to Treatment (RT). Upon discharge, the nurse will provide the personalized feedback form along with the standard discharge instructions. Based on recommendations from the NIAAA Youth Guide, those screening moderate risk will be referred back to their primary care provider, and those screening high risk will be referred to their medical home and further AOD treatment resources. These AOD specific instructions will be incorporated into the discharge instructions based on the patient's NIAAA two-question screen results.	2	292	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	11	6	\N	2	\N	Primary Aim: Evaluate the effectiveness of the pediatric ED implementation for SBIRT (PEDI-SBIRT) strategy in increasing the occurrence and fidelity of SBIRT delivery at EDs, relative to usual care.  Hypothesis: ED staff, after receiving the PEDI-SBIRT strategy will increase by 30% the proportion of adolescents receiving each element of the SBIRT protocol as indicated: a) validated AOD screening, and for those screening positive, b)  electronic AOD brief intervention (BI), c) review of printout of change plan from electronic BI by ED nursing staff, and d) where indicated (as defined by NIAAA two question screen guidelines) a referral after ED discharge (i.e., continued AOD  discussion/treatment with a health care provider).  Secondary Aim 1: Evaluate the effect PEDI-SBIRT has on AOD use at 3 and 6 months following ED discharge. Hypothesis: After the PEDI-SBIRT strategy commences in an ED, adolescents who screen positive on the NIAAA two  question screen and receive the electronic BI will report decreased AOD use at both 3 and 6 month follow-ups, compared to adolescents enrolled in the study during the usual care phase.  Secondary Aim 2: Evaluate whether ED staff's readiness for organizational change mediates the influence of the PEDI-SBIRT on implementation effectiveness (i.e., fidelity of SBIRT delivery).  Hypothesis: The effect of the PEDI-SBIRT strategy on implementation effectiveness will be partially mediated by ED staff's measured change in organizational readiness to change.  Secondary Aim 3: Evaluate the effect of PEDI-SBIRT on improving linkage to appropriate care (i.e. continued AOD discussion with primary care provider and/or AOD treatment) following ED discharge.  Hypothesis: Adolescents in EDs that receive the PEDI-SBIRT implementation strategy will report higher rates of AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider within 30 days of discharge, compared to usual care	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	1008	\N	\N

RNA Seq data, sequence alignment data in the BAM format will be imported into R and normalized by the trimmed mean of M-values method (TMM)61 , and then transformed by voom method 62 for further analysis.

The 6MWD is a standardized, validated measure of mobility, physical function, and cardiovascular fitness(82), that has been demonstrated to be safe for use in older adults(83). In the WU Hip Fracture exercise study, Binder observed improvements in 6MWD that were greater in EX than CON, with mean increases over 6 months in females of 97±87 meters vs. 66±58 meters respectively, a difference that is considered clinically meaningful for older adults(84).  5.7 Secondary Outcome Measures  Secondary outcome measures have been selected to provide information about 1) the mechanisms hypothesized to underlie the functional improvements that we anticipate in response to the interventions, including appendicular and total LBM using DXA, 1-RM strength for leg extension of both limbs, modified physical performance test (mPPT)(85), gait speed for 8 ft. and 50 ft. (a component of the mPPT) using switchmats with timers (Lafayette Instrument), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)(86, 87), balance (mPPT item and Berg test(88)), BMD of the non-fractured proximal femur by DXA; and 2) the impact of the interventions on daily function and quality of life (FSQ(89), OARS ADL questionnaire(90), HRQ(91), SF-36(92)). All proposed measures have been successfully implemented in WU hip fracture studies, including the 1-RM strength measure, which is feasible and safe in hip fracture patients at the baseline time point.	The study has six collaborating clinical sites each with a clinical site PI and coordinator. The clinical sites are Washington University in St. Louis (WU), Baltimore-University of Maryland/Johns Hopkins (Baltimore), University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC), Hebrew SeniorLife (HSL), University of Colorado (UC), and University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB). The study does not intend to include sites outside of the United States.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Power computations are based on two-sided tests at the 0.05 level of significance. They focus on 6MWD, the primary outcome measure. The null hypothesis that reflects the primary goal of this study is that the change from baseline to six months in the EX group in 6MWD equals the corresponding change in the EX+T group.  We do not have preliminary data in females from which to directly estimate the magnitude of the projected differences from adding testosterone to the supervised exercise program. However, we do have such data from a randomized, controlled pilot study conducted at WU using the same exercise procedures involving 25 frail hypogonadal (T level <350 ng/dL) males ≥65 yrs. within 6-16 weeks of recent hip surgery. In that study, EX was associated with a 6-month increase in 6MWD of +42.7 ± 69.2 meters, as compared to +82.2 ± 92.5 meters in the EX+T group. If we assume that the benefit of adding testosterone to EX in female hip fracture patients will be of similar magnitude as the observed benefit in the male study, the sample size requirements are 68 per group for a power of 0.8, and 91 per group for a power of 0.9. After accounting for a 20% dropout rate, these sample sizes increase to 85 and 114, respectively. Our plan to randomize 100 subjects per group provides statistical power of 0.86, for an alpha level of 0.05.  The power computations described above are conservative for two important reasons. First, they are based on 80 subjects per group. This number reflects the assumption that no follow-up data will be available on 20% of the 100 who are randomized into each group and whom we assume will drop out before 6 months. But many of the assumed dropouts will not leave the study until after they have provided 3-month data. The availability of those additional 3-month data combined with the imputation procedures we will employ with respect to the missing 6-month data in these subjects means that power will be greater than what we have calculated when we employ our mixed model analyses using intention-to-treat. Second, all dropouts will be strongly encouraged to provide 6-month primary endpoint data. While some will be unwilling to do so, our experience has been that many will be happy to contribute in this limited way to the scientific goals of the study. This will further enhance statistical power. An added point is that we have computed power for the key comparison between EX and EX+T. However, to the extent that EX is superior to control, the power for the comparison between control and EX+T will be substantially greater than the 0.86 value calculated above.  Although we believe that a sample size of 300 subjects will be sufficient for the primary analysis, we will discuss the possibility of an interim futility analysis with the Data Monitoring Safety Board (DSMB) prior to initiating the study, to guard against the possibility of wasting resources unnecessarily.  The analysis of data will be based on the Intention-to-Treat principle under which all patients randomized in each group will be analyzed as a part of that group regardless of subsequent events.    Specific Aim 1addresses the question of whether T therapy combined with supervised exercise (EX+T) will induce greater improvements in the 6MWD relative to the CON and EX conditions alone. The primary goal of this study are to determine if there are between-group differences in the change over time in 6MWD. Analytic strategies are based on the fact that all outcomes, including secondary outcomes, are continuous variables scheduled to be measured on at least three occasions. Initial analyses will include chi square tests and t-tests to compare baseline values of key demographic, clinical, and physiologic parameters. Because we expect the primary outcomes to be normally distributed or transformable to normality, between group comparisons of 6MWD will be performed using mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance. All mixed model analyses will be implemented using PROC MIXED in SAS and will be preceded by an evaluation of the data, intended to determine what covariance structure should be used. Since past experience suggests that correlation coefficients between time points will be greater for time points that are closer together than for time points that are further apart, we anticipate that an autoregressive or a Toeplitz covariance structure will be appropriate for these analyses. If correlation coefficients are approximately constant regardless of the time between assessment points, we expect that a compound symmetric covariance structure will fit the data best. Decisions about which covariance structure will be implemented will be made only after correlation coefficients across time have been evaluated and with appropriate considerations of the Schwarz-Bayesian criterion and Akaike's Information criterion. All other things being equal, we will give preference to correlation structures that require the estimation of the smallest number of parameters. In addition to the primary comparison of the overall model, statistical contrasts will be evaluated to determine if there are significant between-group differences in the change from baseline to 3 months and from baseline to 6 months, with the 6-month comparison being the primary study time point. Additional analyses of covariance will be performed that adjust for baseline values and covariates that differed across groups at baseline.    Specific Aim 2: The mixed model approach discussed above will be applied also to secondary endpoints. In all of the analyses we perform, we will assess the appropriateness of the selected analytic methods by determining whether required distributional assumptions are satisfied. Thus, when t-tests are performed, we will evaluate normality and equal variance assumptions before accepting the results of the test. When analyses of variance and covariance are performed, regression residuals will be evaluated to ensure that normality assumptions are satisfied. When necessary assumptions are violated, potentially useful data transformations will be considered and evaluated. In some circumstances, inappropriate distributional properties in combination with the failure to find an appropriate data transformation may lead to a decision to use non parametric rather than parametric methods of analysis. Thus, when we say above that we will perform a t-test, it is possible that the t-test will be performed on the log transformed data or that we will use Wilcoxon's test as an alternative. It is similarly possible that we will apply our mixed model analyses to transformed data or that it will be necessary to perform these analyses semi-parametrically using the ranks of the data rather than the data themselves.    Missing data will be a particular concern in our mixed model analyses. To address this issue, we will collect information about reasons for the missingness to facilitate an assessment of whether missing data are ignorable. To formally determine whether data are missing completely at random, we will use a SAS macro to implement the likelihood ratio based method of Little (122). When data are missing completely at random, multiple imputation using PROC MI in SAS will be used to impute missing values and standard mixed model analyses will incorporate these imputed values. Understanding the reasons for missingness and assessments of whether variable values at baseline (when data are complete) are associated with the likelihood that they are subsequently missing will help us decide whether the data are missing at random. Unfortunately, it is not possible to test whether missing data are non-ignorably missing because the very definition of such data implies that the missing data depend on other data that are not available. If we believe that data may be non-ignorably missing, we will adopt a conservative approach to analysis and impute values that bias towards the null hypothesis. For example, if evidence suggests that subjects may have dropped out for reasons related to limited response to the interventions, we will bias towards the null by assuming that the missing data on these subjects are equal to the worst value of the outcome measure that was observed for any subject at the time points that are missing. To minimize the burden of missing data, we will encourage all subjects who withdraw from the study to undergo the final assessments that, at the very least, provide information about the primary endpoints. Our experience suggests that many subjects who choose to drop out are willing to cooperate in this way. Finally, when we suspect non-ignorable missingness, we will perform sensitivity analyses that use more than one approach to imputation in order to evaluate the robustness of our conclusions.    Specific Aim 3 addresses the question of whether the effects of the interventions persist after six months of discontinuing them. Analyses in this aim will be similar to those described for the primary specific aim in that they will employ mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance. The central differences are that analyses for this aim will include the 12 month time point and will focus on the statistical contrasts that perform between-group comparisons of changes from 6 to 12 months. In addition to p-values, we will generate confidence bounds that quantify the potential differences between the 6 to 12 month changes in different groups. We omit the details of these analyses and emphasize only that considerations related to determining covariance structures and dealing with missing data are identical to those previously discussed.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The research team members have no financial ties or other financial conflicts of interest related to this study.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Over a 6-month intervention period, participants in each of the study groups will receive treatment with either testosterone gel or placebo gel, and either a home exercise and health education, or supervised exercise that includes three months of progressive resistance training intervention.

Three dose tiers of ELI will be used, and dose finding using an adaptive design.  Dose finding phase will include 40 subjects.  A second phase using the ideal dose to establish safety of early window treatment with ELI in 40 subjects in a second cohort.  A total 80 subjects will be enrolled in cohort 1 and cohort 2 combined.	\N	\N	203	\N	\N	104	\N	\N	All eligible patients who are randomized into the study and participate in either ELI or placebo infusion will be included in the safety analysis.   The adaptive dose escalation design based on a modified CRM will use each cohort of 3 subject treatment arm inclusions to update the posterior DLT probability of the assigned dose tier. The data set will include subject ID, dose tier assignment, and whether a DLT event occurred.     The safety analysis will include all patients, both treatment and placebo arms, to compare data obtained during infusion studies. The data set will include subject ID; dose tier assignment; post-injury hour of study; and data recorded during the infusion study, including vitals, glucose and lactate concentrations, clinical laboratory results, and, when available, PbtO2 and CMD metabolite concentrations. The safety outcome data set will include subject ID; dose tier assignment; post-injury hour of study; 30-day mortality; and GOSe determined at 90, 180, and 365 days post injury.     Analysis of Primary Endpoint  Our targeted MTD is the dose level associated with a 25% probability of DLT. Each of the three dose levels will be assigned with prior guesses of DLT probabilities (0.08, 0.12 and 0.25, respectively) according to the investigator's experience and results from previous studies. A one-parameter logistic model with fixed scale parameter equals to 3 will be chosen to fit the dose-toxicity curve. The logarithm of the model parameter is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.34.     Starting with patient cohort treated at the lowest dose (Dose Tier 1), the posterior DLT probability of each dose level based on the logistic model will be re-estimated after each new patient inclusion. We will choose the dose level with the updated posterior success probability closest to our target DLT rate (25%) to administrate to the next patient. The process will continue until the exhaustion of the proposed sample size, and the dose with the posterior DLT probability closest to 25% will be selected as the MTD.     Analysis of 30-day mortality for all TBI patients will predict a rate of approximately 18 deaths per 100 patients.    15.4\tAnalysis of Secondary Endpoints    Cerebral microdialysis metabolite concentrations: CMD metabolite concentrations will be analyzed using mixed effects modeling, including both random slope (time) and intercept (ID).

Dr. Vespa is proposing a phase II dose ranging, dose finding study of the use of hypertonic exogenous sodium lactate infusion (ELI) in moderate-severe traumatic brain injury patients. The hypothesis is that ELI will improve brain metabolism and  intracranial pressure and is safe to use.	\N	\N	\N	The drug is sodium lactate, which is an FDA approved compound. The FDA product is called Sodium Lactate Injection USP 50 meq (TM) (Hospira), concentration of 5 mq/ml.  The ELI solution is a diluted form of sodium lactate with a concentration of 1.785 meq/ml (200 mg/ml). The three arms will feature different infusion rates to of this dilution to maintain steady state blood lactate concentrations of 1.5-2 mM, 2.1-3.9 mM, and 4-6 mM using a point of care lactate meter (Novanet) to monitor lactate levels and Accucheck to monitor glucose levels every 15 minutes. The infusion will last 12 hours. Hourly sodium blood levels will be checked. Dose limiting toxicity will be defined as a serum sodium increase > 160 meq/ml.    The adaptive dose escalation design based on a modified CRM will use each cohort of 3 subject treatment arm inclusions to update the DLT probability of the assigned dose tier.

Participants will be randomized, with equal assignment, to one of these two study arms.  As it would be unethical to perform sham surgeries, this is an unblinded study. Participants, treating clinicians, and study personnel will be aware of study arm assignment.  All participants will be assessed at 1, 2 and 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months, for the above mentioned study outcomes.  There will be annual follow-up beyond 24 months, for participants enrolled early in the study.    A secondary, exploratory aim of this study is to determine the ability of clinical and diagnostic testing factors to predict study outcomes.	\N	\N	248	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	The primary endpoint of this study is the occurrence of complications from non-operative management and urgent appendectomy at 30 days. The unit of analysis for this aim are individual participants, not the total number or severity of complications. The rationale for this choice is the likely outcome of this study. Based on the published pediatric and adult studies, we anticipate a low rate (3-6%) of 30-day major complications among urgent appendectomy participants, and an even lower rate (1.1%) among the non-operative management group, with both groups experiencing similar types and severity of complications. Given this, the most clinically meaningful and important comparison is how many patients in each treatment arm experience a major complication.     While number of participants experiencing a complication will be the primary endpoint, all complications are important and will be reported. If unusual patterns of complications, either type, severity, or frequency are detected in the primary analyses, they will be investigated with detailed secondary analyses.    Descriptive statistics of study outcomes will report percentages for categorical variables, and means with standard deviations, median, quartiles, and range for continuous data. Checks of assumptions (e.g., normality) of underlying statistical procedures will be performed and corrective procedures applied if needed.    A Mantel-Haenszel statistic, assessing the effect of intervention on primary outcome controlling for site, will be calculated to test the hypothesis of no difference. It is expected that, for both the final analyses as well as interim analyses, the asymptotic version of the Mantel-Haenszel test will be appropriate. In the case of low outcome counts, a stratified exact score test will be carried out. Specifically, a logistic model will be fit where treatment factor level predicts primary outcome, conditional on stratum, and an exact significance test will be used. A two-sided significance level of 0.05 will be used. Major complications in each treatment arm will be summarized as a proportion, and the observed treatment effect will be reported as a relative risk or an odds ratio, with a corresponding 95% confidence interval.    As we expect some missing outcome data, we will use multiple imputation techniques to perform an intention-to-treat analysis and include all possible study subjects in the analyses. We will generate five imputed datasets by fully conditional expectation, using backward selection to choose sufficiently predictive models for each variable given the others. Models will be constrained to include treatment arm. Although such an approach will rely on an assumption of missingness at random and accuracy of the models used, this method is fairly robust.  We will also perform complete-case analyses and other sensitivity analyses to assess whether the results are robust. Subjects who withdraw from the study will have all data that are accrued up until the time of withdrawal included in the analysis.    Endpoints at 6 months and 2 years constitute the secondary outcome measures of this study. They include the major- and minor complication rates and the appendectomy-free rate. The minor complication outcome will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary outcome. The success rate of initial non-operative treatment (the percentage of participants who are appendectomy-free at 6 months and 2 years) will be calculated with a corresponding 95% confidence interval. Overall health utility will be compared between treatment groups using a Van Elteren test, stratified by site. The results will be presented using summary statistics for each treatment group (mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range). These secondary outcomes will each be allocated a significance level of 0.025 to adjust for multiple comparisons.	\N	\N	\N	\N	4	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	None.	\N	\N	\N	f	Consecutive, eligible patients at the 8 participating sites will be approached for the study. We anticipate 3-6 months to activate all sites. The sites vary in their volume of appendicitis patients; we anticipate a low volume site enrolling 2-3 participants per month, vs. a high volume site enrolling 10-12 participants per month.  We anticipate 34-38 months to enroll our study sample; this estimate is based on pooled enrollment data from 10 pediatric pilot studies of this topic.	This is a study of non-operative vs. surgical management of acute, uncomplicated pediatric appendicitis.  996 eligible patients will be randomized to either initial treatment with antibiotics only (2 doses of intravenous piperacillin-tazobactom; if clinically improved after 12 hours of in-patient observation, discharge on 1 week of either ciprofloxicin/metronidazole or cefixime/amoxicillin-clavulanate) or urgent laparoscopic appendectomy.	\N	\N	\N	Non-operative management will consist of:     -Two doses of intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam 6 hours apart, followed by     -one week of oral antibiotics, ciprofloxicin (twice a day) and metronidazole (three times a day); participants who are unable      to tolerate these oral antibiotics, will be offered cefixime (twice a day) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (three times a day).	2	269	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	6	8	\N	2	\N	Specific Aim 1: Determine the major complication rate at 30 days of non-operative management of acute appendicitis in children.

We hypothesize that non-operative management will have a significantly lower complication rate and that 70% of these patients will be appendectomy free at 2 year follow-up.    Specific Aim 2: Determine the overall health utility and cost of non-operative management of acute appendicitis in children, compared with urgent appendectomy. We hypothesize that non-operative management of children with acute appendicitis will result in significantly better health utility and lower cost than urgent appendectomy..

Assuming a study population with 60% CHD and based on results from contemporary clinical trials in patients with stable CHD, we anticipate the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke to occur at rates between 6-9% after three years. Recent trends of decreasing event rates in patients with stable CHD let us assume a conservative estimate of 6% for both the NEM and CEM arms. We determined our goal for a 95% confidence interval to include an event rate difference of �1.4% among the two strategies. Sample sizes were calculated using the binomial distribution with Pearson Chi-Square (two-sided) confidence intervals, assuming 90% power and alpha=0.05. With event rates of 6% in each arm, our requisite sample size is 4,758 (2,379 in each arm) with 90% power, alpha of 0.05 and follow up loss of 7%.   We anticipate approximately 30-40% of patients to be female. Average age will be 60 years. All patients are being referred for cardiac catheterization with symptoms suggestive of severe coronary artery disease. Patients across North America-including urban as well as rural areas-will be invited to participate.	19	Our study population will include patients 18 years and older with stable angina pectoris or equivalent angina symptoms who have been referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of CHD. These patients have been evaluated/tested by physicians who view the probability and severity of CHD sufficiently high to warrant invasive evaluation (AHA/ACC class I or IIa indication for invasive coronary angiography). Patients with prior history of CHD will be included. By standard criteria, these patients will be of intermediate to high pretest probability of obstructive CHD. Patients will be excluded from participation if they have a history of anaphylactic reactions to iodine contrast, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, severe heart failure, suspected or recent acute coronary syndrome, or planned major surgery necessitating interruption of antiplatelet therapy.	\N	1.\tPrimary Outcome #1 (Injury Outcome) is defined by the three-year rate of the composite outcome of myocardial injury, kidney injury, major bleeding, or vascular injury.  2.\tPrimary Outcome #2 (Adverse Events) is defined by the three-year rate of the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.  3.\tMain Secondary Outcome (cost outcome) is defined by the three-year direct and indirect three-year costs.	60-70 US medical centers will be asked to participate.

Randomization will occur in simple 1:1 fashion using a computer generated permuted block design and stratified by site. Patients randomized to the experimental strategy will undergo coronary CT angiography instead of cardiac catheterization and proceed only to revascularization with high-risk coronary anatomy. Patients randomized to the invasive strategy will undergo cardiac catheterization and invasive coronary angiography as planned. Angiography results will be evaluated by the clinical team at the study site and management will be implemented according to local practice.	\N	\N	481	\N	\N	71	\N	\N	The precision margin of �1.4% (�0.46 events per 100 person years) was chosen after careful consideration of numerous factors. High precision must be weighed against practicality and cost concerns as well as desired study impact on clinical practice. We believe the chosen margin will provide convincing evidence to researchers and clinicians to alleviate concerns about excess risk of severe adverse events with NEM-particularly, given substantial supporting data applicable from medical treatment vs. PCI in patients with stable CHD. Furthermore, the anticipated large difference in the composite injury outcome is expected to favor NEM, even in the setting of a difference between the two strategies close to the pre-specified margin. Importantly, the selected precision margin reflects the fact that we used conservative assumptions for anticipated event rates as well as for the presumed zero difference between the two groups. Given available data, it is not unreasonable to assume lower risk of the composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke for NEM in which case study precision will further increase. Should-against our expectations-greater precision be required, collaborative efforts and meta-analyses built on the foundation we provide will allow a more precise estimate of differences between the two strategies.     Data Analysis: Corresponding to the randomization, the primary analysis for the injury outcome will be by marginal logistic regression in which the parameter of interest is the ratio of the log odds of injury comparing persons in the NEM to those in the CEM arm. Possible clustering of the events within each of the site centers will be accounted for using Generalized Estimating Functions (GEE; Liang and Zeger, 1986); however, we expect clustering to be negligible because of the design for balanced randomization within each center.  As a secondary analysis, time to events will be taken into account using discrete survival analysis with 6-month intervals to take account of changes in the rate of events over the 3 years of follow-up. As a secondary analysis, we will test for a trend in the treatment log odds ratio with follow-up time. For the adverse event outcome, a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio of the treatment effect, as well as the unadjusted rate difference between the two event rates will be constructed using the same GEE approach.     In addition to injury and event outcomes (Specific Aims 1 and 2), health status measures, resource utilization and costs will be measured (Specific Aim 3).  The health status measures will include the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the SF-12 and the EQ-5D, the latter for assessment of utility.  Resource utilization for the initial procedure, and follow-up costs will be estimated, based largely on Medicare payment schedules and Redbook wholesale acquisition costs.  Indirect costs are difficult to measure but to be included.  Survival will be estimated from Census survival estimates as well as available databases.  This will permit the estimation of quality adjusted life years.  The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be determined, as well as its distribution in the cost-effectiveness plane and with cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.  A probabilistic sensitivity analysis will allow for assessment of the distribution of the ICER.  Societal impact of expected decrease in PCI procedures, but on cost and clinical outcomes, will be estimated based on incident rates of PCI and complications as noted in the clinical literature and from existing databases.	\N	\N	\N	\N	6	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	22	Nothing to disclose.	t	\N	\N	f	Recruitment feasibility is of utmost importance for any clinical trial. To explore pathways to improve recruitment efficiency, we propose to collaborate with the NCATS-CTSA program, which may possibly use our trial as a model for improving trial efficiency through a number of innovative interventions. As each CTSA program hub has 5-6 satellite centers each, utilization of all or part of the NCATS TIN network would allow adjustment of recruitment sites according to actual screening yields and demands of the final approved study schedule. For example, a total of more than 100 or even 200 recruitment centers may be employed to enroll patients if enrollment rates are unexpectedly low. Alternatively, EHR cohort identification and NCATS trial innovation methodologies might be capable of an increase recruitment to possibly 4-5 patients per month allowing limiting the number of trial sites to approximately 40 sites. Therefore, an important goal of a collaboration with the NCATS-CTSA program would be to substantially increasing recruitment efficiency to ?2 patients per site/month. Our proposal was discussed with the Cardiology Leadership at the NHLBI who were very enthusiastic about a collaboration with the NCATS-CTSA program in support of CINEMA.     We view site development as key to successful recruitment and we are planning for intensive efforts in this regard. Specifically, stakeholders, including administrators, patients, general practitioners, general cardiologists, and interventional cardiologists, at each site center will be engaged to solicit involvement and by-in for the trial. The goal for this engagement is to develop a consensus among stakeholders on an algorithm/policy for patient recruitment at each site that greatly enhances recruitment efficiency. The demonstrated academic interests of selected centers could be ideally suited to translate efficiency efforts into practice.     Past experience, particularly with the ISCHEMIA trial, has raised concerns about institutional equipoise among recruitment centers, particularly, in the US. An important advantage of CINEMA-if our hypotheses are confirmed-are the expected very large cost savings due to approximately 50% fewer catheterizations and revascularization procedures. Given recent developments in the health services reimbursement structure, which include a strong trend of abandoning the fee-for-service model and moving towards bundled payments and capitation, there are clear incentives for healthcare systems to focus on lower expenses associated with the same medical conditions.  CINEMA is closely aligned with this paradigm and thus will be very attractive to US medical institutions, which in turn will generate support for our recruitment efforts. Therefore, our study design and the timely study potential of CINEMA will be ideally suited to meet or exceed our recruitment goals.	The JHU/Tufts TIC and RIC conducted an Initial Consult for Dr. Zadeh's project entitled "Comparing Invasive vs. Noninvasive Evaluation and Management of Angina - The CINEMA Trial." CINEMA proposes to randomize 4,706 patients with symptoms suggestive of stable coronary heart disease referred for cardiac catheterization to a noninvasive evaluation and management strategy using cardiac CT vs. the current standard of invasive angiography. Patients will be followed for three years for the outcomes of procedure related injuries and a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The Investigator hypothesizes that the noninvasive evaluation and management strategy will lead to fewer patient injuries and lower costs without excess risk in adverse cardiac events.    CINEMA Goals are to test an evaluation and management strategy which:   1)\tDisengages the process of diagnosing coronary heart disease (CHD) from immediately performing revascularization  2)\tReserves revascularization to patients who are likely to derive a survival benefit  3)\tReduces patient injury and hospitalizations  4)\tLeads to substantial cost savings (>$1,000,000,000/y)  5)\tTriggers a paradigm shift in the management of CHD  6)\tStrengthens the role of/redirects resources to prevention  7)\tUltimately leads to improved population health  CINEMA Specific Aims:   1.\tTest the hypothesis that among patients with suspected, stable coronary heart disease (CHD), a non-invasive evaluation and management strategy using cardiac CT imaging (NEM) is superior to the conventional, invasive strategy (CEM) for the outcome of patient injury (primary outcome #1) defined by the three-year rate of the composite outcome of myocardial injury, kidney injury, major bleeding, or vascular injury.  2.\tDetermine the difference between the two strategies in the three-year rates of the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (primary outcome #2) with precision of plus or minus 1.4%.  3.\tTo test the hypothesis that among patients with suspected, stable CHD, a non-invasive evaluation and management strategy using cardiac CT imaging (NEM) is superior to the conventional, invasive strategy (CEM) for of total three-year costs the (main secondary outcome).	\N	\N	\N	CINEMA tests a specific evaluation and management strategy in patients with suspected, stable coronary heart disease which restricts invasive procedures and coronary artery revascularization to patients with high-risk features.

Active dose will titrate up from 3.5mg to 21mg in the first 6 weeks of treatment, remain at 21mg for 22.5 months, and then taper down in the final 3 weeks of treatment.

Power and Sample Size Determination: Sample size calculations are based on the attention measure (reaction time standard error) change from baseline from the CPT. Six month change for the nicotine group was -0.04, and for the Placebo group was 0.018. Using the observed standard deviation of 0.16, an alpha level of 0.05, 122 participants per group would be needed to detect this difference with 80% power. This sample size would also provide at least 80% power to detect the observed differences from the pilot study for the CGIC (103 participants needed per group), and the principal measure of memory (delayed word recall) (64 participants needed per group). Anticipating dropouts of approximately 20-25% across the course of two years, the sample size will be increased to 150 participants enrolled per arm (300 total).    Statistical Analysis Plan: In general, biomarker and clinical outcome analyses will incorporate the modified intent-to-treat principle, namely, all randomized participants with both a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement will be included in the analysis while the safety analysis will be conducted on the intent-to-treat population (all randomized participants). All results will be reported as point estimates (proportions or mean differences across groups, as appropriate) and interval estimates (95% confidence intervals) with two-sided p-values denoting significance. No adjustments for multiple comparisons on secondary outcomes will be made and a p-value of 0.05 will be considered significant. Statistical analysis will be conducted using the statistical software R (www.r-project.org) or SAS.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	There are no conflicts of interest for this study.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Each site will receive a 3-Fold Brochure about the study, which they can personalize with their own contact information, a one-page flyer to post in doctor's offices and other public venues.

RDS involves identification of initial participants, termed "seeds" who in turn recruit others, and who in turn recruit others, until the desired sample size is reached. Upon enrollment in the PROUD-R2 study, all participants will be assigned the allocation as designated to their cluster (parent RDS chain). The randomization will be stratified by site and will be weighted for RDS chain length. Each cluster will be allocated to receive instruction on standard retention strategies or a more in depth recruitment and retention training as well as continued support and incentives for retaining peers.	\N	\N	31	\N	\N	10	\N	\N	For our primary outcome (study retention at 12-months-Aim 1), we will test whether retention is higher at 12 months in the peer-driven retention arm compared with standard retention. To do so, we will conduct regression modeling with the retention arm (peer-driven vs. standard) as the dependent variable and retention at 12 months as the independent variable (retained vs. not retained). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be used to account for the correlation introduced by the clustering of chains within sites. Since the outcome is dichotomous, we will use GEE with a logit link and 95% confidence intervals obtained from bootstrapped standard errors to correct for potential underestimation.2 When modeling the correlation structure, we explore different covariance matrices and choose the one that best fits the data. We will use RDS weights in our regression analysis. As recommended in the RDS methodology literature, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis comparing weighted to unweighted results of GEE.3-7    To calculate the weights, we will use the Volz-Heckathorn (VH) estimator. This estimator consistently outperforms the Salganik-Heckathorn estimator and produces more stable results for short recruitment chains.8,9 Because of the ongoing UG3 studies, we will start recruitment for this study in the middle of some chains (see Figure 2) thus anticipate some shorter chains may be included in this study. Further, the VH estimator does not rely on population size - which is not known or easily estimable in our population - unlike other estimators like the successive sampling estimator.     For the analysis of the willingness to participate in future clinical trials we use descriptive statistics to report responses and assess associations between participant characteristics, including randomization assignment, using the methods described for retention outcomes.  We will evaluate group differences in willingness to participate in future trials between the standard and peer-intervention arm at 6 and 12 months using GEE regression methods similar to those outlined for Aim 1.     For the analysis of participant preferences for participation in clinical trials, we will use STATA 15 to analyze preference data (patterns of choices and determine directionality and relative importance of each attribute level) using mixed multinomial logit (MNL) and generalized MNL (GMNL) models.    Qualitative analysis of Aim 2 and Aim 3 will also be used.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	21	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	All National Rural Opioids Initiative (NROI) participants enrolled after April 2019 in Oregon, Ohio and Kentucky will be offered to participate in the concomitant PROUD-R2 study through a concomitant, but separate consent form.

Optimal strategies for recruiting and retaining people with opioid use disorder in clinical research in rural America remain unknown.  The Peer-based Retention Of people who Use Drugs in Rural Research (PROUD-R2) study leverages the national Rural Opioids Initiative infrastructure, with sites in rural Oregon and Appalachian Kentucky and Ohio, and partnerships with three Clinical and Translational Science Award sites and the NIDA Clinical Trials Network to test an innovative peer-based strategy to improve research participation and retention of people who use drugs in rural communities.	\N	\N	\N	Each cluster, or Response Driven Sampling chain, will be randomized to either the control arm or the intervention arm.

This study will be a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a stepped wedge design, each clinic begins to enroll patients using the usual care dissemination method. Then, each cluster, one-by-one, crosses over to using the H-SDM toolkit dissemination method (one cluster will crossover every 6 months).  Training for the H-SDM toolkit will begin during the last month of the Usual Care period for each cluster. Each cluster will enroll approximately 7-9 participants per time period. Enrollment will end 27 months after study initiation.   A total of 260 participants (parents of young children with SCD) will be enrolled and complete measures at baseline, and 4-6 months later in-person or online via REDCap. Data on clinician offering of hydroxyurea, hydroxyurea uptake and healthcare utilization will be collected throughout the study. Fidelity will be assessed using a checklist and by reviewing audio recordings of clinic visits (20% of visits).	\N	\N	304	\N	\N	61	\N	\N	The data will be analyzed based on the intent-to-treat principle. All patients will remain in the arm of the study to which they were randomized, regardless of whether or not they receive the assigned dissemination method. Missing data will be handled using multiple group multiple imputation (with M = 100 imputed datasets) (Cox, Smith, Brown, & Fitzpatrick, 2009) consistent with currently accepted methodological practice. (Godin, Bélanger-Gravel, Eccles, & Grimshaw, 2008).  Aim1: Data from all participants at all time-points will be aggregated within treatment group assignment and analyzed as such. Intervention groups will be compared on baseline characteristics, including demographics and laboratory measurements, using descriptive statistics. Specifically, for Aim 1, each of the M = 100 imputed data sets will be analyzed testing for significant DCS and Dyadic Option mean differences between Toolkit and Usual care groups using two specific a-priori analytic techniques: 1.) All predictor and both response variables will be group-mean centered (using the site-specific mean) prior to analysis to address nesting (non-independence) within site by reducing each variable's ICC to zero, and 2.) parameter estimate constraints in multiple-group SEM will ensure that the assumption of homogeneity of covariate regression slopes is met when controlling for the influence of parent age, parent health literacy, participant gender, participant age, disease severity, and SES on DCS and Dyadic Option means between groups. Aim 2: The secondary outcomes of hydroxyurea knowledge and child reported health outcomes will be evaluated using similar methods to eliminate site level variance prior to data analysis.  Specifically, we will analyze response variables (hydroxyurea offered, hydroxyurea uptake) as binary categorical and convert parameter estimates to odd ratios for interpretation. Specifically, for part one of Aim 2, simple logistic regression analyses will be performed on each of the M = 100 imputed datasets to determine significant differences between Toolkit and Usual Care after controlling for the covariates listed in Aim 1. For part 2 of Aim 2, multiple-group SEM with covariates, as outlined in Aim 1 above, will be used to test for significant group differences in hydroxyurea knowledge, PEDS-QL sickle cell disease (SCD), Ages & Stages, Health Literacy, fetal hemoglobin levels and ANC. For the third part of Aim 2, healthcare utilization variables (number of hospitalizations, ill visits, and emergency room visits) will be analyzed as count variables and examined in exploratory analyses. ER visits, hospitalizations, and ill visits count differences will be assessed with count variable analyses that first determine whether Poisson or negative binomial count distribution analyses are needed prior to testing for significant Toolkit versus Usual Care mean rate differences. We will also conduct process improvement, senstivity (subgroup) and fidelity analyses.	\N	\N	\N	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	9	This study is being funded by a contract from PCORI: PCORI CDR_1609_36055.	t	\N	\N	\N	Enrollment is scheduled to begin in March 2017 (all sites will begin active recruitment by May 2017). Each site will enroll 1-2 patients per month for 4 time periods (each time period is 6 months in length). Enrollment will be completed 27 months after the study begins. This estimate is based on prior multisite studies in SCD with more invasive procedures (e.g. neuroimaging).Recruitment and retention are crucial to the successful completion of this trial.	Overview    This is a phase II/III designed to determine if the use of the hydroxyurea shared decision making toolkit (H-SDM toolkit) dissemination method is more effective than the ASH clinician pocket guide dissemination method (usual care) at increasing clinicians' ability to implement sickle cell-specific evidence-based guidelines and improve/maintain patient-centered health outcomes.     Objectives    The specific aims of the study are to evaluate the effectiveness of the usual care dissemination method (clinician pocket guide) and the H-SDM clinician toolkit dissemination method on:   •\tParent report of decisional uncertainty (primary outcome chosen by parents of children with SCD),   •\tParent perception of experiencing shared decision-making,   •\tParent knowledge of hydroxyurea,  •\t Number of children offered hydroxyurea,   •\tHydroxyurea uptake (those with active prescriptions),   •\tChild health outcomes (pain, neurocognitive functioning, sickle cell related quality of life and healthcare utilization).	\N	\N	\N	Usual Care: In this condition, sites will provide current guidelines for offering hydroxyurea and use the American Society of Hematology (ASH) pocket guide as a reference. ASH developed 'The Hydroxyurea and Transfusion Therapy for the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease' clinician pocket guide based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Evidence Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease: Expert Panel Report, 2014.' The pocket guide recommends use of shared decision making.     Hydroxyurea shared decision making toolkit (H-SDM toolkit): During the H-SDM toolkit condition, sites will develop methods for identifying Eligible Patients & Monitoring Progress, have the opportunity to use Implementation Tools, and will use the Visit Decision Aids. The H-SDM toolkit has four visit decision aids to support parents in their decision about hydroxyurea: pre-visit brochure, in-visit issue card, after-visit booklet and video narratives {videos of parents telling their story about how they made a decision about hydroxyurea).	2	237	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	19	9	\N	2	\N	Primary objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of the usual care dissemination method (clinician pocket guide) and the H-SDM toolkit dissemination method on: parent decisional uncertainty  about hydroxyurea (primary outcome chosen by parents of children with SCD and parent report of shared decision making when talking with their child's clinician about hydroxyurea.

We would like to integrate a comprehensive clinical support system (CDS) into the Johns Hopkins electronic health record (EHR) that is aimed at improving sepsis diagnosis and management.  We have successfully completed a pilot/feasibility study at Johns Howard County (JHHC).  We would like to implement the CDS at JHH, JHBMC, and JHHC, and assess if the CDS improves time-to-sepsis-diagnosis, and/or adherence to evidence-based guidelines on sepsis management relative to the present standard of care. We anticipate that each hospital will serve as its own historical control (pre/post intervention).  This will be an unblinded trial (i.e., providers will know that they are using the CDS, but they will be blinded to the study results during the trial).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Dr. Saria and team developed the CDS being studied in the present trial, but will not receive financial compensation for implementing or evaluating the CDS.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	We conducted a pilot study on our clinical decision system (CDS) at JHHC, and found that it was feasible to link it with the Johns Hopkins electronic health record (EHR) system, and thereby guide workflow.   Our HIPAA compliant CDS uses a cloud-based architecture that integrates with EHR and:  a) alerts the healthcare team of patients at-risk for sepsis, b) provides data summaries on the given patients, and c) promotes and tracks task completion by the healthcare team based on evidence-based sepsis management guidelines.  The CDS identifies "at risk patients" by using the validated Targeted Real-Time Early Warning Score (TREWScore) developed by our team-a machine-learning based algorithm that uses real-time patient data to identify patients at risk for sepsis.      We will be incorporating the CDS with the EHR at JHH, JHBMC, and JHHC during the study period, and will be monitoring for change in time-to-sepsis-diagnosis and adherence to sepsis management guidelines (as well as the potential secondary outcomes listed above).	2	273	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	Primary Objective:  To assess if implementation of the CDS into the electronic health record improves time-to-sepsis-diagnosis and/or adherence to evidence-based guidelines on sepsis management (relative to the present standard of care).

Participants completing the usability testing will attend a single study visit  (although the session may take place several weeks after enrollment).    Patients participating in the quasi-experimental study will complete participation in approximately 4 weeks. All follow-up will be conducted remotely, at 1 and 4 weeks post-ED visit.	During Phase 1, stakeholders will participate in the development of PROMPT-ED. Up to 5 patients (with their parents) will be recruited to participate in a collaborative design team. Up to 20 additional patients will conduct usability testing on the patient portal, and up to 20 more patients will conduct usability testing on the tailored discharge instructions. In all cases, participants will be aged 8-17, and efforts will be made to recruit participants who are diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender.   During the development of PROMPT-ED (Phase 1), up to 4 clinicians will also participate in the collaborative design team. Up to 30 additional clinicians will be recruited to contribute to PROMPT-ED development via usability testing or participation in system "walk throughs." Patients and clinicians participating in the elements of Phase 1 described above will only be recruited from the Cincinnati and Washington DC sites. However, clinicians from all sites may contribute input on some elements of PROMPT-ED via survey.  For the quasi-experimental trial (Phase 2), approximately 1600 8-17 year old patients of varying gender, race, and ethnicity will be recruited from 4 EDs in Cincinnati, OH, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, PA, and Denver, CO. All 4 sites serve diverse patient populations. Two sites (Washington, D.C. and Denver) serve populations that are 5-20% Spanish-speaking, and will enroll Spanish-speaking participants. The other sites serve populations that are under 3% Spanish speaking, and will enroll only English-speaking patients. All participants will have sustained an mTBI within the previous 24 hours.  All clinicians at all study sites will be invited to complete the pre-implementation satisfaction survey. All clinicians who complete at least 3 evaluations of patients using PROMPT-ED will be invited to take the survey assessing PROMPT-ED acceptability.	51	For patients enrolled in the quasi-experimental clinical trial:  Inclusion: children from 8-17 years of age who present to the ED within 24 hours following an injury to the brain via a traumatic insult or undergoing an acceleration/deceleration movement, and with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 to 15.    Exclusion: Patients who are critically ill, have a history of developmental delay or severe mental illness, who present without their legal guardian or are wards of the state or unable to understand English or Spanish (except at sites that currently lack capacity to enroll Spanish patients, e.g. Cincinnati and Philadelphia), will be excluded since these conditions may preclude them from being able to provide informed consent/assent and/or complete self-assessments.     Phase 1 patient usability testers will be recruited based on the same eligibility criteria described above. Patient members of the collaborative design team will be eligible if they have a PAST history of mTBI and otherwise match the eligibility criteria that will be employed in the trial. Participants in the collaborative design team and the usability testing will only be recruited from 2 study sites (CCHMC and CNMC).    Clinicians will be eligible complete surveys if they are ED clinicians who could evaluate and diagnose mTBI patients at any of the 4 study sites. Clinician collaborative design team members and usability testers during the development phase of this work will be eligible based on the same criteria, although they will only be recruited from 2 study sites (CCHMC and CNMC).	\N	Our primary patient-related outcome is health-related quality of life assessed at 4 weeks. Our process-related outcomes are mTBI diagnosis and issuance of discharge instructions for those children who meet the diagnostic criteria for mTBI.  Other tertiary patient-related outcomes include psychosocial functioning, symptom burden, adherence, social support, participation in activities, and health-care utilization assessed at 1 and 4 weeks post-injury. Other tertiary process-related outcomes include screening rates, clinician acceptability,  and impact on ED length of stay	Four pediatric EDs will enroll participants, all of which are located in the United States:  Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC, Cincinnati, OH), Children's National Medical Center (CNMC, Washington, D.C.), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP, Philadelphia, PA), and Children's Hospital Colorado (CHC, Denver, CO).	\N	\N	\N	\N	Approximately 46 months.

In Phase 2, we will conduct a 2-phase quasi-experimental trial. All eligible patients presenting to one of the 4 participating sited EDs will be eligible for study participation. In pre-implementation phase, data will be collected from patients in the ED via the PROs portal and for the follow-up arm at 1 and 4-weeks. These data will not be linked to the EHR or CDS. In post-implementation phase, patient procedures will be identical, but data will be linked to the EHR and visible to treating clinicians, along with CDS. Clinicians will assess the acceptability of both approaches.	\N	\N	204	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	Phase 1 does not have a hypothesis-driven aim as it is a process related procedure. For measures with quantitative data, the analyses will be largely descriptive in nature, reporting the measures of central tendency and variability. For the patient usability testing of the PROs portal and the clinical CDS, the think-aloud transcripts will be analyzed to code positive and negative themes related to content or format, understandability, and usefulness of the content. For analysis of the Delphi consensus opinions about the content and format of the discharge instructions, we will use Kappa to estimate the chance adjusted level of agreement among raters based on the compiled ratings for the topics.     The primary outcome analysis, assessing HRQoL of the patient as measured by the parent PedsQL at 4 weeks, will compare pre-intervention scores to post-intervention scores, controlling for site and time through segmented linear regression, with the individual as the unit of analysis. The secondary outcomes, mTBI diagnosis, and mTBI discharge instructions issuance will both be compared between intervention periods through segmented logistic regression, controlling for site, with the individual as the unit of analysis. For both of these analyses, an interaction term between time and intervention phase (pre vs post) will be assessed.     All other tertiary outcomes will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons, as these are more exploratory in nature.	\N	\N	\N	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	8	No conflicts of interest to report.	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	The study objective is to improve emergency department care and patient outcomes for children who sustain a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) by building and implementing Patient-Reported Outcomes for Mild Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury initiated in the ED (PROMPT-ED), a sophisticated integration of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) with the electronic health record (EHR) and clinician decision support (CDS). In phase 1, PROMPT-ED will be built, incorporating stakeholder input. Phase 2 consists of a multi-site pragmatic quasi-experimental trial. The hypothesis is that the intervention will improve both the patient-related outcome of health-related quality of life measured 4 weeks post-mTBI and process-related outcomes of the frequency of mTBI diagnosis and issuance of discharge instructions in those who meet mTBI diagnostic criteria.	\N	\N	\N	In Phase 1 of the study, patient and clinician stakeholders will contribute to the development of PROMPT-ED, but no intervention will take place.     In Phase 2, we will conduct a multisite quasi-experimental clinical trial of the PROMPT-ED intervention. (The full PROMPT-ED intervention will consist of patient-entered symptom reporting via a patient portal, linkage of patient-reported symptoms to the electronic medical record, and clinician decision support based on patient-reported symptoms). In the pre-implementation phase of the intervention research, patient-entered data will be collected but NOT linked to the electronic health record or clinician decision support. Those participants who are approached and consented to the follow-up arm of the study will also complete validated health-related quality of life measures in the ED and at 1 and 4 weeks post-visit. In the post-implementation phase, patient procedures will be the same, but the patient-entered data will be linked to the electronic health record and clinician decision support, and patients will receive context-specific paper and electronic discharge instructions.	2	290	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	18	4	\N	2	\N	Our objective is to improve children's health-related quality of life following mTBI through systematic ED care.

Massachusetts (MA) Cancer Registry data identified the following characteristics of Boston residents with greatest delays in breast cancer treatment: Black, Hispanic, non-English speaking, and public health insurance. The MA Cancer Registry also identified six health systems in Boston that care for over 90% of these women. Therefore, we have partnered with these six health systems for this study. They include: 1. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; 2. Boston Medical Center; 3. Brigham Women's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; 4. Faulkner Hospital; 5. Massachusetts General Hospital; and 6. Tufts Medical Center.	42	Eligibility criteria: All women with breast cancer diagnosed at a participating study site during the study period will be eligible for inclusion if they meet three study criteria:  1. are an adult female > 21 years of age; 2. reside in the City of Boston; 3. have any of the following risk factors for delays in care: are Black and/or Hispanic ethnicity, do not speak English as their primary language, have no more than a high school education, and/or have only public insurance or are uninsured at the time of diagnosis.  Exclusion criteria include:  1. cancer diagnosis made > 60 days prior to enrollment, such that the ability of the intervention to effect the outcome is limited; 2. presence of a cognitive impairment such as dementia or delirium from any cause (e.g. metabolic, medication or drug induced), given the unique challenges to their treatment decision making/ adherence and the fact that the intervention would not include the patient directly, but rather the family; 3. home residence is outside of the city of Boston, Massachusetts.	\N	Our study is powered on the clinical effectiveness outcome. Our primary study outcome is Time to initiation of cancer treatment, a continuous outcome defined as the number of days from diagnosis (Time 0) to treatment initiation (Time 1). Treatment initiation is defined as the time from biopsy until first treatment for cancer, either surgical, radiation, or systemic therapy. Table 2 displays the specific data elements that will be used to define treatment initiation. As some patients have had pre-operative chemotherapy or hormone therapy, the time period will vary for each patient. This outcome has been widely used in existing navigation studies, as it has been linked to mortality and survival outcomes.         Table 2.

Approach: We will design and conduct a mixed-methods, multi-level assessment of existing evidence-based  processes across the city of Boston to establish a baseline status of these three intervention strategies: patient  navigation, patient registries/tracking systems, and screening/referral for social determinants of health. Mixed methods  include quantitative surveys and qualitative key informant interviews and observations to ensure a  comprehensive assessment of known and unanticipated roadblocks to evidence-based implementation. Multilevels  relate to the multiple layers of the health system: patient, providers, health system administrators and  community-based programs.     Aim 2) Develop a generalizable regional registry to monitor breast cancer treatment utilization and  outcomes across Boston.  The approach to this challenge will be as follows:  1. A joint collaboration of the informatics service at each of the healthcare systems, along with community  engagement with breast cancer clinicians, and state and city public health officials,  a. This collaboration will outline the data elements for inclusion in the data dashboard, and sources of the  data for each element, and the timeframe to electronic capture of each element relative to the patient's care.  We will utilize and extend existing metrics for initiation and completion of care.  2. We will establish a repository of fully identified administrative and clinical data from multiple clinical  sites across Boston for all newly diagnosed breast cancers. Using a Master Patient Index (MPI), information on  the same patient who appears in multiple systems will be assigned to a single (encoded) identity.    Aim 3) Create a platform to conduct systematic screening for social determinants of health and provide  systematic referral tools to address these barriers to care.  Approach:  Building on existing expertise and tools developed for the City of  Boston, we will develop a systematic process that will identify these patient barriers and assist their care  providers in accessing community resources to address them.     Aim 4) Conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to monitor for reduction in delays in  cancer care among Black, non-Hispanic women in Boston.  Approach: Using Aim 1 data on existing barriers and facilitators to implementation of the three tools, the  community Coalition will lead implementation of the identified best practices for the three tools across the  Boston health systems, including relevant community programs. We will use an effectiveness-implementation  hybrid type 2 study design which combines elements of clinical effectiveness and implementation research to  enhance public health impact of study findings.  We will work with the stakeholders to design an intervention 'Toolkit' targeted at barriers,  standardizations, independent checks, reminders and learning from mistakes. We will execute the Toolkit  across the health systems in Boston using and Observational Stepped Wedge Design, where the intervention  is rolled out in a staggered manner over time, in groups of experimental units, so that as time goes on, more  and more units experience the intervention. By the end, all units experience the intervention.	\N	\N	569	\N	\N	124	\N	\N	The primary analyses will address delays in receipt of four specific types of therapies from time of diagnosis: 1) dates of surgery - initial and final surgical procedures, 2) dates of chemotherapy - initial data, final dates, and percentage of recommended dosages achieved, 3) dates of radiation therapy - initial and final dates of service, proportion of fractions delivered, and 4) dates of hormonal therapy initiation and adherence.       We will conduct an Observational Stepped Wedge Design, where the intervention is rolled out in a staggered manner over time, in groups of experimental units, so that as time goes on, more and more units experience the intervention.

Navigator protocols will include tailored Workflow maps that specify how each navigator will identify newly diagnosed breast cancer cases who meet our eligibility criteria within each of the six clinical sites. The clinical site PIs will provide oversight to ensure all cases are enrolled to receive the navigation delivered intervention. We expect every eligible patient to be enrolled, as the TRIP intervention will be implemented as a standard of care at each participating site.	Brief Description  A stepped wedge design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial among 1100 vulnerable (minority, low-income) breast cancer patients seeking care across six academic medical systems in Boston assessing clinical effectiveness and implementation of the integrated intervention (patient registry, screening for health-related social needs (HRSNs) and patient navigation.)    Aim 1:  conduct a mixed methods assessment to characterize existing barriers to and inconsistencies in the implementation of patient navigation, patient registries, and screening for social determinants of health.  Aim 2:  Develop a generalizable regional registry to monitor breast cancer treatment utilization and outcomes across Boston.  Aim 3:  create a platform to conduct systematic screening for social determinants of health and provide systematic referral tools to address these barriers to care.  Aim 4: Conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to monitor for reduction in delays in cancer care among black, non-Hispanic women in Boston.	\N	\N	\N	The intervention includes three distinct components:  1. A real time patient registry that is shared across the six health systems. The registry will be built using the HIPAA compliant REDCap platform and function as a 'tickler file' embedded into the navigator workflow. This navigator tool provides an automated process that prioritizes the navigator's caseload, and directs them with an actionable list of patients with pending clinical encounters. Sharing navigation process data across the health systems will address known fragmentation in care that leads to delays in treatment.  2. A systematic screening and referral system to identify and address HRSNs. The screening/referral system will be built using the HelpSteps platform. At baseline, 3 and 6 months women in the intervention arm are asked to identify needs categorized into 15 social domains described in the Research Strategy. Women will be asked to pick the two most pressing domains and then will be asked a series of questions to identify the precise services needed for each domain. These data will be available and stored in the registry for use by the patient navigators. At each contact, the navigator will check on the status of referrals and assess whether a woman would like to receive additional referrals from similar or different domains. 3. Patient Navigation services following standard operating procedures that are guided by the Principles of Care Management in collaboration with a network of navigators across the six health systems. This includes: a) identifying women eligible for navigation services; b) identifying barriers to engaging in timely cancer care services, with a particular emphasis on social barriers; c) providing assistance to address these barriers through local and regional resources; and, finally, d) tracking women over time across the participating clinical sites to ensure they complete their entire course of cancer care. The innovation here is the integrated network of navigation across regional health systems.	1	94	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	80	6	\N	1	\N	1) Conduct a mixed-methods needs assessment to characterize existing barriers to and inconsistencies in the implementation of: patient navigation, patient registries and screening for social determinants of health.

We will include all male and female patients 15-21 years of age regardless of their chief complaint, and exclude only those patients who are unable to understand English or Spanish, who are critically ill, have cognitive impairment or altered mental status, or who would be unable to provide consent for completion of the SHS and STI screening. The study population will be limited to those patients available from the six sites during the specified collection time periods.    Sample Size:  1) Workflow Analyses: We estimate that we will observe between 20-30 individuals per site, which is a common sample size for studies of ED workflow processes.91, 92   2) Pragmatic Trial: We plan to enroll at 6 PECARN sites. Based on PECARN data, with 6 sites for 52 two-week periods, we conservatively anticipate that approximately 288 patients or more per two weeks per site will arrive. Of these, we conservatively expect to enroll 242 per site. About 220 of these will be asymptomatic and included in the primary analysis.	18	We will include all male and female patients 15-21 years of age seeking emergency department care, regardless of their chief complaint, and exclude only those patients who are unable to understand English or Spanish, who are critically ill, have cognitive impairment or altered mental status, or who would be unable to provide consent for completion of the SHS and STI screening. The study population will be limited to those patients available from the six sites during the specified collection time periods.	\N	1) Workflow Analyses: The primary outcome will be workflow process maps from the patient's perspective that  illustrate the specific tasks performed by clinicians, the flow of information between patients and clinicians, and  the interactions between patients, clinicians, and technology (e.g. devices and EHRs). The process maps will  identify areas where new technology and processes can be introduced.  2) Pragmatic RCT: Our primary outcome measure will be GC/CT testing and detection rates per 1000 eligible  patients during each 2-week period. We will compare these rates among the usual care, targeted screening,  and the universally offered GC/CT screening strategies. Secondary outcomes will include a comparison of  GC/CT positive rates between patients in the high and low risk sexual strata (determined by the patient entered  SHS) as well as the proportion of positive GC/CT cases successfully treated within 14 days. Process measures  will include length of ED stay for each eligible patient during each phase and technological malfunctions during  the targeted and universally offered STI screening phases. Additionally, we will measure the proportion of  patients who agreed to be tested for GC/CT, and the proportion of visits during which the clinician followed the  CDS recommendations. These will be measured overall and by STI risk strata.  3) Cost-effectiveness analysis: Costs will be captured in 2017 U.S. dollars. For the simple decision analytic  model, effectiveness will be measured as STIs detected. For the more detailed decision model, we will use  quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to capture the impact of STI complications occurring or being averted due  to screening and subsequent treatment. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be in units of  dollars spent per STI detected in the simple model and dollars spent per QALY gained in the detailed model.	The study will be conducted at each of the 6 participating PECARN pediatric EDs, which include Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus, OH), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA), Lurie Children's Hospital (Chicago, IL), Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI), Denver Children's Hospital (Denver, CO), and Texas Children's Hospital (Houston, TX).	\N	\N	\N	\N	36 months	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Purpose: The goal of this study is to determine the most clinically effective and cost-effective STI screening approach for adolescents when implemented in a real-world emergency department setting through a pragmatic trial.      Design: workflow analyses which will then inform the implementation of a pragmatic multicenter trial using stepped wedge design where a targeted or universally offered STI screening protocol will be sequentially rolled-out to sites over multiple time periods. The order of the the initial intervention will be randomly assigned. By the end of the study, each site will have data collected at baseline, during implementation of a universally offered STi screening strategy, and during implementation of a targeted STI screening strategy.	\N	\N	182	\N	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	5	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	Adolescents are disproportionately affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and often access the  emergency department (ED) for care. Because the ED may serve an at-risk population who may otherwise be  difficult to reach, identifying the most clinically efficient and cost-effective method by which to deliver this  preventive health service is urgently needed. This multicenter comparative effectiveness pragmatic trial seeks  to compare a targeted screening strategy (screening only those disclosing high risk sexual behavior) to a  universally-offered screening strategy (offered to all, regardless of risk). We will use an innovative process of  incorporating patient-reported data into the electronic health record to provide clinical decision support for STI  testing that is both patient and clinician focused. This study will contribute to the evidence base that informs  the development of cost-effective and sustainable STI screening programs that can be successfully integrated  in to the clinical workflow of the ED.	\N	\N	\N	Once the ideal workflow strategy is identified at each individual site, all participants in both the targeted and universally offered screening phases will use a handheld tablet device to provide electronic informed consent for participation (Figure 7). All participants will complete the previously developed and validated ACASI SHS containing questions regarding their personal sexual health history.80 The PROs tool will risk-stratify patients for STIs based on their reported sexual experience and/or presence of STI-related symptoms. Using the tablet device, patients will also provide consent for clinician-ordered STI testing (urine-based GC/CT). This will provide clinicians real-time EHR-integrated decision support for GC/CT testing. Since this is a pragmatic trial, the exact process of distributing tablets may differ by site and will be further clarified during the workflow analyses. In Dr. Reed's study, registration staff were responsible for tablet distribution,22 however, at other sites, staff responsible for distribution may include the triage or bedside nurse depending on results of the workflow analyses. The electronic informed consent document will contain information about the study. Should questions arise, RCs will be available to answer more detailed questions. Research staff are available at each participating ED up to 16 hours per weekday and between 8-16 hours on weekends. During hours without RC presence, there will be a CITI-trained clinical provider present to answer questions. Reasons for not offering the tablet will be recorded by the ED staff. Furthermore, if adolescents decline study participation, a reason for refusal will also be recorded on the tablet.  a) Targeted screening: During the targeted screening intervention, data from the SHS will be integrated into the EHR and will provide CDS for GC/CT testing based on SHS-calculated STI risk (developed and validated by Dr. Goyal).19 Patients will be classified as at high risk for STIs if they disclose being sexually active and have either the presence of STI-related symptoms or any of the following high risk behaviors: more than 1 sexual partner in the last 3 months, no condom use during last sex, prior history of STI. Patients will be classified as at risk if they disclose being sexually active but do not disclose having any STI-related symptoms or any high-risk sexual behaviors. Patients will be classified as at low risk if they deny any history of sexual activity (see preliminary data for STI positivity rates by risk strata). When patients classify as at high risk, clinicians will receive CDS that STI testing is "highly recommended"; when they care for patients who classify as at risk, they will receive CDS that STI testing is "recommended"; when caring for patients who classify as at low risk, they will receive CDS that STI testing "is not necessary at this time." If the clinician chooses to follow the recommendation for screening based on patient's risk assessment, and the patient consents to testing on the tablet device, urine GC/CT testing will be performed. \t  b) Universally offered screening: During the universally offered screening intervention, STI screening will be offered to all eligible adolescents, regardless of risk. All eligible patients will also complete the SHS, will be informed of the CDC GC/CT testing recommendations and then be given the option to decline STI testing using the tablet device. During this phase, the SHS results will not be available to the clinician. STI testing recommendations will be based only on the patient's decision to undergo GC/CT testing. Like the process followed in the targeted screening phase, if the clinician follows the CDS that informs the clinician that the patient agreed to GC/CT screening and consequently orders testing, urine GC/CT testing will be performed.  c) Both approaches: If the patient is at risk for STIs and declines GC/CT testing, or the patient simply declines GC/CT testing on the tablet but the clinician believes the patient should be tested, the clinician will have the opportunity to engage in a shared decision-making process with the patient as per routine clinical care. Alternatively, if the clinician declines the CDS GC/CT testing recommendations, he/she will be asked to electronically document the reason the CDS is not being followed. All patients who test positive for an STI will be notified of their results and provided treatment based on each site's standard clinical processes for result notification and treatment. Among all patients tested for GC/CT, the associated primary care clinician (PCP) will be informed of the testing and results via existing communication methodologies including Epic in-basket messages, faxes, or other electronic communication methods, and both patients and clinicians will be encouraged to schedule outpatient follow-up appointments. Medical staff, including faculty, clinical trainees, nurses and other medical support staff, will be educated about each screening intervention prior to implementation and with monthly reminders, through in person staff meetings, emails, and Epic job aids. Clinical staff at each participating institution are familiar with EHR-derived CDS for other clinical processes.	2	315	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	6	\N	2	\N	To determine the most clinically and cost effective STI screening strategy when comparing targeted and universally offered approaches.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	6	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	12500	\N	\N

While the focus of this study is on improving the translation of two clinical interventions for OUDS, we anticipate the CCT could be applied to patients hospitalized with other chronic conditions for which multiple clinical disciplines play important roles in treatment.  The two evidence-based interventions to be implemented are medication assisted treatment (MAT) and re-engineered discharge planning (RED).	\N	\N	\N	Overview  The purpose of the proposed intervention, the Collaborative Care Team (CCT), is to translate evidence based interventions into the care of patients in the hospital setting. The CCT does not replace the function of primary teams. Rather, the CCT supports the ability of the primary team to translate effective treatments in the hospital environment. The consultative model enables the CCT service to deliver more than the sum of its parts, translating effective care for a greater population than would be possible if it were a primary service. The consultative orientation also suggests an adaptive approach, responding to the care setting, the questions of the primary service, and most importantly the needs of the patient. Such flexibility is vital in the hospital setting, where successful interventions must be interwoven in an environment characterized by multiple demands involving primary services, testing, procedures, complications, and requirements for efficiency.     The proposed CCT intervention has four core attributes:   1)\tMultidisciplinary: The CCT is multidisciplinary. The essential members of the team include an addiction medicine specialist and a care manager.  The CCT team supports and interacts with the medical team physician overseeing the patient's care during hospitalization, such as a hospitalist, surgeon, or other specialist.  2)\tPopulation-focused:   The CCT will use a clinical registry to track the care of the population of hospitalized patients with an OUD.   The focus on a population encourages the team to be proactive (rather than just reactive to narrow consultative requests), and to coordinate care beyond the hospital encounter.   3)\tMeasurement-based: The CCT uses standardized assessments to determine the appropriate clinical intervention and level of care.    4)\tEvidence-based: The CCT will implement two evidence-based clinical interventions: MAT and RED.      The proposed CCT has two Essential Roles  1)\tThe care manager has expertise in OUDs and discharge planning. Responsibilities include assessment and engagement, care coordination, and post discharge follow up.   2)\tThe addiction medicine specialist is a physician who holds a DEA X-waiver and/or board certification in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry. Responsibilities include clinical assessment, consultative recommendations, including support for utilization of evidence based medication, supervision of the CCT, and coordination with medical personnel.    Procedures  1)\tThe team will hold weekly meetings, document their clinical reports, assessments, and recommendations in the hospital electronic medical record (EMR) and communicate recommendations to the medical team directly, through the EMR, or in accordance with other hospital procedures for clinical communication.   2)\tThe team will utilize standardized assessments, resources and tools.      a)\tProject Shout: https://www.projectshout.org/      b)\tProject RED: https://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/systems/hospital/red/toolkit/index.html      c)\tCommunity Service Providers: CCT will utilize resource list with community service providers categorized by ASAM level of care, geographic region, insurance eligibility, and patient costs.     d)\tBrief Negotiated Interview: https://www.bu.edu/bniart/sbirt-in-health-care/sbirt-brief-negotiated-interview-bni/ and https://medicine.yale.edu/sbirt/opioidusedisorders.aspx     e)\tASAM Criteria: https://www.asam.org/resources/the-asam-criteria/about      f)\tASAM Standards of Care for the Addiction Specialist Physician https://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/publications/standards-of-care-final-design-document.pdf	1	321	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	32	3	\N	2	\N	The main intent of this study is to determine whether an interdisciplinary, collaborative care team (CCT) increases the T3 translation of evidence-based interventions for opioid use disorders (OUD) relative to usual care (UC) in hospitalized patients with OUDs, improving patient outcomes.  We hypothesize that patients randomized to the CCT arm will have higher rates of MAT initiation and successful linkage to follow-up OUD treatment (primary outcomes) than those receiving UC.  We will also examine the effect of the CCT on completed after-hospital care plans, OUD treatment engagement, MAT utilization post hospital discharge, linkage to outpatient medical care; rehospitalization and emergency department use, and self-reported opioid misuse 30 days post-hospital discharge	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	864	\N	\N

The target population will be persons with prodromal Alzheimer's dementia, overweight or obese, without known diabetes that requires treatment. Prodromal Alzheimer's dementia will be defined as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (AMCI), using the Peterson criteria, and pre-AMCI (also known as early AMCI), defined by memory test cutoff of 1 standard deviation instead of the typical 1.5 standard deviation used in the Peterson criteria. We do not propose biomarker evidence of AD for inclusion into the study. Overweight or obese will be defined by a body mass index (BMI) ? 25 m/k2  . Persons with known diabetes will be excluded because they are already on metformin or other diabetes medications. However, persons with newly discovered diabetes with a HbA1c of less than 7% will be considered for inclusion with agreement from their physicians if they are deemed not to require pharmacologic treatment.	39	o   Inclusion Criteria    �  Diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (AMCI) by Petersen Criteria.

Brain MRI will be conducted at baseline and 24 months.	\N	\N	660	\N	\N	143	\N	\N	Analytic Plan for the Primary Aim. The primary aim for this study is to compare changes from baseline to 24 months in verbal memory performance, measured with Total Recall Score of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and overall cognitive performance, measured with the Alzheimer cognitive composite from the Alzheimer's disease cooperative study (ADCS-PACC), between the metformin and placebo arms. The primary null hypothesis H0 states that there is no difference between metformin and placebo arms on change in total recall in the SRT from baseline to 24 months of follow-up. We will follow the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle in which participants are analyzed based on the group to which they are randomized regardless of early termination, missing data or errors in randomization detected post hoc.  To test H0, we will use linear regression to compare metformin and placebo controlling for site, because randomization will be conducted within each of the  study sites.  The primary analysis model is of the form EY =?+?T+??iXi for i=1,..., 12, where EY is the expected change in total recall in the SRT from baseline to 24 months, Xi denotes an indicator for study site i , and T is the treatment indicator for metformin (vs. placebo). The regression coefficient ? estimates the expected mean difference in the changes the primary outcomes between the 2 arms, and thus represents the effect of metformin treatment on the primary outcomse.  Assuming no significant group differences in participant characteristics at p < 0.05 two-tailed, the primary analyses will be those described above. If there are any significant group differences in baseline participant characteristics, we will adjust for such variables in the regression models and report the adjusted treatment coefficient, and its significance level, in the primary results. In secondary analyses, we will check for a treatment by site interaction. If this is significant at the .05 level, we will attempt to determine potential effect modifiers, i.e., measured variables that (i) relate to outcome, (ii) have different mean level across sites, and (iii) modify the treatment effect. Effect modifiers (such as age, APOE-?4 genotype, pre-AMCI vs. AMCI) could 'explain' an observed treatment by site interaction. If found, we will adjust the analysis by including these effect modifiers and will then check if the treatment by site interactions can be removed.  If no explanation can be found, we will report the separate intervention effects in our primary findings.    Analytic Plan for Secondary Aims. Our secondary aims compare imaging biomarkers between metformin and placebo on an ITT basis. The analytic approach will be the same as described for the Primary Aim.	\N	t	\N	\N	13	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	49	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	We are planning a project of 5 years duration (standard NIH R01 grant).

Secondary aim 1: To compare changes in total brain volumes ascertained on brain MRI from baseline to 24 months between metformin and placebo.    Hypothesis 2: The metformin arm will show less brain atrophy compared with placebo.     Secondary aim 2: To compare changes in cerebrovascular disease, ascertained as white matter hyperintensity volume on brain MRI, from baseline to 24 months between metformin and placebo.    Hypothesis 3: The metformin arm will show less increase in white matter hyperintensity volume compared with placebo    Secondary aim 3: To examine whether the effect of metformin on the primary and secondary outcomes is modified by age, APOE-e4 genotype, pre-AMCI vs. AMCI status, and degree of insulin resistance ascertained with the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA).    Hypothesis 4: The benefit of metformin on the primary and secondary outcomes will be strongest among younger subjects, those without APOE-e4, those with pre-AMCI, and those with the highest insulin resistance.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	600	\N	\N

This latter group includes individuals affected by autoimmune thyroid disease and individuals who have undergone radioactive iodine therapy for hyperthyroidism.	28	Inclusion Criteria:    ?       Use of LT4 at a dose of 1.2 mcg/kg/day or higher. The average dose in the absence of a thyroid is 1.6 mcg/kg/day [e.g., 112 mcg/day for a 70 kg (154 lb) individual]. We seek participants with little to no endogenous thyroid function.  ?       TSH of 0.5-4.0 within 2 months of enrollment. Lack of optimization of thyroid testing could contribute to residual symptoms. We seek participants who are symptomatic despite TSH levels that are within a standard reference range.  ?       Stable dose of LT4 for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Recent changes to LT4 dosing could affect symptoms. We seek participants who are persistently symptomatic despite stable LT4 dosing.  ?       Dissatisfied with LT4 therapy. See below under Specific Populations.       Exclusion Criteria:    ?       Current use of LT3 or thyroid extracts.  ?       Unstable cardiac condition. This includes uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, or angina.  ?       Current pregnancy or planned within the next 12 months. Frequent monitoring and dose titration are required during pregnancy. Any participants who become pregnant during the study will terminate the study.  ?       Diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus. TSH testing is not reliable in patients with these rare conditions.  ?       Active treatment for malignancy, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer. Patients with thyroid cancer who do not anticipate therapy with radioactive iodine over the next 12 months will be eligible for enrollment, as will women with treated breast cancer on stable doses of estrogen antagonist therapies, such as tamoxifen.  ?

While many patients respond well to the standard treatment with levothyroxine (synthetic T4), a  significant proportion complain of symptoms despite normalization of the thyroid hormone and TSH  levels. This is attributed to a deficit in conversion of T4 into hormonally active T3, or to lack of  endogenous T3 produced by the thyroid gland. Some studies suggest that supplementation of the  therapy with synthetic T3 (liothyronine) or thyroid extracts may improve the quality of life of patients  dissatisfied with the standard of care. Additionally, a common genetic polymorphism of the type 2  deiodinase (Thr92Ala) appears to play a role in the response to the treatment. In this study the team proposes  to assess whether alternative treatment options provide clinically significant improvement in diseasespecific  quality of life and metabolic parameters in hypothyroid patients dissatisfied with the standard of  care therapy.	\N	\N	\N	We will randomize the study groups to LT4 alone, LT4 plus LT3, and thyroid extracts in a 1:1:1 fashion; LT4 and thyroid extracts will be administered on a once-daily regimen, while LT4 plus LT3 therapy will be administered on a twice-daily regimen. In the LT4 plus LT3 arm, the baseline LT4 dose will be reduced by 25 mcg of LT4 and 5 mcg LT3 twice daily will be added. The substitution of LT4 for thyroid extracts will be performed replacing 1 mg of thyroid extract for 1.47 mcg LT4, rounded to the nearest 10 mg. The study medications will be formulated in capsules by the University of Pennsylvania research pharmacy and the LT4 alone and thyroid extract arms will contain an LT3 placebo to mask the treatments.

Normality of distribution will be assessed using QQ plots, and if the assumptions are not met, alternative or nonparametric methods will be used. For genetic data, SNPs that have call rates less than 95% or that are monomorphic will be removed from the analysis. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium will be tested for . Genotype calls will be assessed for any signi\fcant deviations. A signifi\fcance level of 0.05 will be used taking into consideration multiple comparisons.    Speci\fc Aim Analyses  Speci\fc Aim 1. To determine whether plasma levels of coagulation and inflammation-related biomarkers (e.g., sTM and Ang-2) are associated with increased mortality, MODS, and long-term morbidity among survivors and to identify biomarker cut-offs for potential therapeutic trials.    Analysis plan for specifi\fc aim one.  Regression models will be used to evaluate the effects of the biomarkers and SNPs on the primary outcome of mortality (logistic regression) and secondary outcomes of morbidity at 1-year (ordinal logistic regression). These models will include terms for clinical covariates as well as markers of interest. Initial evaluation for each marker will construct a model including that marker in addition to the clinical variables. Different formulations of the biomarkers within the models (e.g., baseline, the slope of the biomarker over time) will be considered. [23]    In order to estimate cut off values for biomarker levels to guide therapy, the Youdin index will be calculated. The Youden index is the sum of the sensitivity and specifi\fcity. For a single biomarker evaluation, we will create the ROC curve and then make a choice about what cutpoint to use. Depending on the intended use of the marker there may be a number of ways to choose the cut-point. A minimum level of the sensitivity or speci\fcity could be decided on and then maximize the other based on that criteria. Maximizing the sum of the sensitivity + speci\fcity (Youden) to get a cut-point that is a bit more  balanced and attempts to maximize overall performance will be tried. The CART analysis is a decision tree method that searches for the best possible cut-point for one or more variables at a time. If a single biomarker is put into a CART analysis, it is likely to come up with the same cut-point as using the ROC curve and maximizing the Youden index.  Speci\fc Aim 2. To determine whether genetic variants in genes of coagulation and inflammation-related mediators (e.g., sTM and Ang-2) are associated with higher plasma levels of these markers and with mortality, MODS, and long-term morbidity among survivors.    Analysis plan for specifi\fc aim two.

Initial evaluation for each marker will construct a model including that marker in addition to the clinical variables. Different formulations of the biomarkers within the models (e.g., baseline, the slope of the biomarker over time) will be considered. [23] For the SNP models, dominant or co-dominant modes  of inheritance will be considered. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) will be used to adjust for multiple testing for the SNP associations with the outcomes. Finally, multimarker regression models will be constructed including the signi\fcant clinical, biomarker and SNP markers in a single prediction model. AUC will be computed for the logistic model and the c-statistic for the Cox-model to evaluate the overall predictive utility of the markers. 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the effect of model selection on the performance of the prediction models will also be used.    Speci\fc Aim 3. To test and validate our previously published prognostic inflammation and coagulation-related biomarkers (PAI-1, IL6, IL8, IL10, sTNFr) and published prognostic models such as Latent Class Analysis [26].

This study aims to examine the relationship between clinical and biological markers associated with mortality, long-term outcomes, and new morbidities among ARDS survivors. This study will identify predictive bio-markers to provide a link between bio-markers and clinically relevant outcomes.

Our chief aim is to compare short-term (3 months post-baseline, which is 1 month post-intervention) and long-term (9 months post-baseline, which is 7 months post-intervention) outcomes after the HeartHealth intervention versus usual care on the primary endpoint of the single CVD risk factor reduction goal (i.e., blood pressure, one element of lipid profile, body mass index, or physical activity level) chosen by the participant in the first week of usual care or intervention (goal setting is an intervention component). We hypothesize that the 2-month HeartHealth intervention, by actively promoting self-care of co-morbid CVD risk factors, will be superior to usual care in promoting achievement of patients' CVD risk reduction goals.  Specific Aim 2. Compare short-term and long-term outcomes on the secondary endpoints of each of the following CVD risk reduction goals: blood pressure, lipid profile, body mass index, and physical activity level for intervention versus usual care groups.  We hypothesize that CVD risk factors will be better in HeartHealth intervention group versus usual care.  Specific aim 3. Compare the impact of HeartHealth to usual care on secondary endpoints of hsCRP, a biomarker of CVD risk, on adherence to recommended CVD risk reduction measures assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale, a behavioral marker, and on a psychological factor, depressive symptoms, which interfere with adherence to life-style modification.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

We hope to have data analysis complete within 90 days as this is pilot data being gathered for a potentially much larger trial.	90 participants will be enrolled from 3 of 18 participating PECARN EDs. Children 6-12 years of age who are treated for an asthma exacerbation as determined clinically by the principal ED provider based on symptoms such as shortness-of-breath, cough, and wheezing. The child's symptoms must improve following ≥1 doses of albuterol and ≥1 doses of systemic corticosteroids such that he/she can be safely discharged home. Children must have physician-diagnosed asthma as reported by parents or documented in the electronic medical record. The child must be a full-time student in a participating school. Only children and parents who speak English or Spanish are eligible due to limited funds to acquire interviewers who speak and study materials written in alternative languages. Children with or without a history of prior ICS use are eligible as adherence is an important determinant of treatment outcome in both groups.	107	Inclusion criteria are:  •\tChildren 6-12 years of age; AND  •\tTreated for an asthma as determined clinically by the principal ED provider based on symptoms such as shortness-of-breath, cough, and wheezing; AND  •\tThe child's symptoms must improve following ≥1 doses of albuterol and ≥1 doses of systemic corticosteroids such that he/she can be safely discharged home; AND  •\tThe child must have physician-diagnosed asthma as reported by parents or documented in the electronic medical record; AND  •\tThe child must be a full-time student in a participating school.  •\tThe child must speak English or Spanish; AND  •\tChildren with or without a history of prior ICS use.

Enrollment will take place only from these three PECARN locations:  University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center  Medical College of Wisconsin/Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (University of Wisconsin)  Children's National Health System (CNHS) (George Washington School of Medicine)  Each site will be responsible for approximately 30 subjects each.  There will be no sites outside of the U.S.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Approximately 9 months. We plan to begin enrollment in late August/Early September when the three schools open for the school year.

Children will be randomized to ED-based ICS prescribing with home supervision or ED-initiated ICS dispensing with at-home and at-school supervision. All children will be treated with a standardized medication regimen consisting of once-daily budesonide inhalation powder (Pulmicort Flexhaler®) supplemented by as-needed albuterol sulfate (ProAir®).	\N	\N	227	\N	\N	19	\N	\N	Randomization of 90 patients allows estimation of consent and acceptance rates to within ± 6% (half-width of 95% confidence interval). With 45 subjects in each arm, we will be able to estimate recidivism to within approximately ± 15%.  The subjects for the proposed research children 6-12 years of age (grades K-5) who are treated for an asthma attack as determined clinically by the principal ED provider (e.g., shortness-of-breath, cough, wheezing that improves following ≥1 doses of albuterol or equivalent and ≥1 doses of systemic corticosteroids). The child's symptoms must resolve so that he/she can be safely discharged home. Children must have physician-diagnosed persistent asthma as reported by the child's parents and/or recorded in the HEDA's electronic medical record. Children must be enrolled full- time (5 days/week) in a participating school and must be 6-12 years of age with a physician diagnosis of asthma.  Parents must speak English or Spanish. We expect the children to be 40% female, 30% Hispanic, 54%     black and 45% white (30% are Hispanic White).      We expect children to be 40% female as is the national population of asthma among children; therefore, females will be adequately represented. We expect that approximately 84% of the children who enroll will be minorities: including approximately 54% black and 30% Hispanic. Therefore, minorities will be well represented in this research.    All resources required to implement school-based supervision will be measured including personnel time and medication courier fees. Asthma-related medical costs (e.g., ED visits) will be estimated using a gross-costing method where costs are bundled by service type (e.g. $600 per ED visit) rather than micro-costing where costs are individually aggregated (e.g. nursing time, medication, procedure costs at each ED visit). Gross-costing is more practical and reliable than micro-costing when a wide variety of service events and locations are being measured. Our primary source of cost data will come from medical record review to identify asthma-related ED visits; however, this will be supplemented by research logs (e.g. intervention-related personnel time and courier fees) and parent interviews (e.g., prescription fills for ICS albuterol among the control group). Where possible or needed these data will be crosschecked against existing estimates from secondary sources such as the published literature.	\N	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	No conflicts.	t	\N	\N	f	To ensure random selection of participants, each ED will screen patients during pre-specified windows scheduled by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). In order to avoid enrollment bias, the DCC biostatistician will create a randomized screening schedule for each site based on the availability of research staff and local census patterns. The screening schedule will also set monthly enrollment targets to achieve the recruitment goal.    Research staff will approach parents of children who are being treated for symptoms consistent with an asthma attack. The research staff will explain the study and will provide parents with a brief written description. Written consent will be obtained from parents; verbal assent will be obtained from children. To avoid interfering with clinical care, recruitment and study procedures will occur when the patient is not actively engaged in treatment (e.g. waiting for testing to commence and/or results to return). Given a 6-hour turn- around between presentation and discharge  within PECARN EDs, we anticipate adequate time will be available to identify, recruit, and evaluate study participants. To ensure all participants can complete 90 days of school-supervised treatment before summer break, recruitment will commence in August-September (school start) and will cease February-March (90 days prior to school end).    To achieve our 90 participant goal, each site will be expected to enroll 8 participants per month over a 4-month window. If needed, recruitment can continue for two additional months.	The investigator intends to demonstrate that Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Emergency Departments (ED) can dispense inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and arrange its use in the school setting following successful management of an asthma attack. Furthermore, they intend to demonstrate this intervention is well-accepted by families, clinicians, and schools. The hypothesis of this study is that they can reduce asthma exacerbation risk by increasing adherence with daily controller medication in the schools.	\N	\N	\N	Within the ED, care will be provided at the sole discretion of the primary ED provider including all tests, procedures, and treatments deemed appropriate to restore pulmonary function and safely discharge the participant home. At discharge, participants will receive either:    ED-prescribing (control): Participants will receive 3 prescriptions: (1) 40 mg of prednisolone once daily for 5 days or its equivalent, (2) 360 μg of budesonide inhalation powder (Pulmicort Flexhaler®) once daily for at home use, and (3) albuterol sulfate as needed for relief of acute respiratory symptoms.    ED-dispensing with home and school supervision (intervention): Participants will receive care as described above except instead of providing a prescription to participants they will be given a Pulmicort Flexhaler and albuterol inhaler for home use and an additional Pulmicort Flexhaler and albuterol inhaler will be couriered to the child's school health office within 3 business days of ED discharge. School health personnel will supervise the child's use of once-daily budesonide each school day. Parents will be instructed to supervise their child's at-home use only on weekends, holidays, and school absences.  Subjects in the intervention arm will have observed medication use in the school with a once daily dose of 360mcg.	2	280	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	9	3	\N	2	\N	Specific Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of dispensing inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department and supervising its use in the school setting.

They will need to be located near at least one of our 12 recruitment sites to be considered for participation.	44	In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of  the following criteria:  • Aged ≥50 years to <85 years  • Shoulder pain and/or loss of active motion, strength or function  • MRI-confirmed partial- or full-thickness supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus  tear of 4cm or less in longitudinal dimension  • Medically fit for surgery, defined as Category I-III per American Society of  Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification (see Table 1: ASA Physical  Status Classifications and Examples)  Any individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from  participation in this study:  • Primary diagnosis is something other than a rotator cuff tear  • History (in last 2 years) of shoulder fracture involving the humeral head on  affected side  • Previous rotator cuff surgery on affected side  • Isolated subscapularis &/or teres minor tear on affected side  • Acute rotator cuff tear caused by a severe trauma (see TABLE 2: Trauma  Classification)  • Shoulder used as a weight-bearing joint  • Contraindication to MRI (claustrophobia, pacemaker, pregnancy, shoulder  implant, etc.)  • Glenohumeral osteoarthritis on xrays/MRI  • Grade 4 fatty infiltration of rotator cuff (any tendons)  • Candidate for reverse shoulder arthroplasty or total shoulder arthroplasty at  Baseline	\N	The primary outcome measure is SPADI, and the primary endpoint is the change in SPADI at 12 months relative to baseline. SPADI is measured on a scale of zero to 100, with lower scores for better outcomes. SPADI is a reliable and valid measure of shoulder function15-20. The secondary endpoint is ASES-SF13, cross-sectionally and longitudinally over time.

A sample size of 700 patients will be enrolled with approximately equal numbers of patients randomized to operative treatment and non-operative treatment using computerized randomization. The purpose of surgery is to repair a torn rotator cuff whereas that of physical therapy is to strengthen and stretch the shoulder and peri-scapular muscles. At baseline, patients will fill out study questionnaires and undergo a brief physical examination. Follow-up will be performed via questionnaires at 3, 6, and 12 months.	\N	\N	161	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	OPTIONAL	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Grant support from NIH/NIAMS and PCORI, The PI is associate Editor for American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Associate Editor for Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery Research and Education Committee: Association for Academic Physiatrists	\N	\N	\N	\N	Study participants will be recruited through the clinics of designated recruiting physicians at each site.

These are both standard of care treatments for rotator cuff injuries.     Operative treatment will include an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery. As in usual clinical practice, patients will have post-operative physical therapy after surgery. The post-operative physical therapy lasts for approximately 4 months. A standardized post-operative physical therapy regimen for this trial is included in Supplemental Materials.    Patients randomized to non-operative treatment will only receive physical therapy. This usually lasts for approximately 3 months.	1	310	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	12	\N	2	\N	Aim 1: To compare pain and function in patients undergoing operative versus non-operative treatment of atraumatic rotator cuff tears at 12 months of follow-up.

As this study seeks to enroll relatively healthy participants with moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder, recruitment and retention will be a challenge throughout the study. It is not uncommon for this population to experience several barriers to initiating and being retained in study activities including, but not limited to unstable living arrangements, irregular schedules, legal problems, unreliable transportation, and financial insecurity. Men use methamphetamine more than women do. Thus, oversampling women to support analysis of treatment effects by gender also will be challenging. This multi-site study will be conducted at a variety of institutions in seven cities across six states. Each study site will have recruitment challenges specific to their unique set of variables.	47	Inclusion: 18 to 65 years  old; Interested in reducing/stopping methamphetamine use; Speak English; meet DSM-5 criteria for moderate/severe methamphetamine use disorder; Self-report methamphetamine use ? 18 days in the 30 day period prior to consent;  Provide at least 2 (out of 3) urine samples positive for methamphetamine during screening; If female of childbearing potential, agree to use acceptable birth control methods and have periodic urine pregnancy testing unless documented hysterectomy; Meet subjective and objective measures of being opioid-free prior to naltrexone induction, including passing naloxone challenge; Willing to comply with all study procedures and medication instructions; Agree to use a cell phone to record videos of medication dosing.

Eligibility will be determined during a maximum 21 day screening period. To document an appropriate level of current methamphetamine use, prospective participants must submit at least two urine samples positive for methamphetamine of a possible three tests to occur within a 10 day period during which clinic visits occur with at least two days between visits. In addition, participants must self-report MA use on 18 or more days in the 30 day period prior to consent using the Timeline Followback (TLFB) and meet diagnostic criteria for moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder per DSM-5 (4 or more criteria) at screening. After screening is completed and eligibility is confirmed, including successful administration of a naloxone challenge, participants will begin the 12 week medication phase of the trial. Participants will be randomized to either the 1) AMC arm and receive injections of extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX; as Vivitrol�) plus once-daily oral extended-release bupropion tablets (BUP-XL) or the 2) matching placebo (PLB) arm and receive injections of placebo (iPLB) plus once-daily oral placebo (oPLB) tablets. This protocol will utilize a sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD), originally proposed by Fava et al. (2003), and later revised by Chen et al. (2011). A feature of this design is that it can reduce the overall placebo response rate. One advantage of the adaptive aspect of the design is that it requires a smaller sample size compared to a standard two group randomized trial design. During the course of the study, participants may be switched to another arm, as determined by the a priori adaptive aspect of the study design. Participants appearing to respond well to their original treatment assignment will not be switched. Overall, approximately 50% of the participants will receive the AMC. Injections will be administered every three weeks, in weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Take-home oral study medication (BUP-XL or oPLB) will be dispensed weekly for dosing on non-clinic days. Participants will be asked to attend the clinic twice weekly for observed oral medication dosing, assessments, collection of urine samples, and once-weekly medical management. On non-clinic days, participants will participate in smartphone app-based medication adherence activities. Participants will be asked to complete assessments as indicated on the schedule of assessments. Following the 12 week medication phase, participants will complete a follow-up phase, including a medication taper and post-medication phase follow-up visits during weeks 13 and 16.	\N	\N	560	\N	\N	132	\N	\N	The primary efficacy outcome measure is MA-negative urine drug screen (UDS) test results over the course of twice-weekly visits, which will be compared by treatment group (AMC versus PLB). Participants will be defined as a 'responder' if there are at least 75% MA-negative UDS tests during the pre-specified evaluation period. The treatment groups will be compared as to the proportion of responders using a Z test. All treatment comparisons will be performed under the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) criteria. The sample size calculation for our study was conducted as described in Tamura (2007). Various assumptions on the sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD) parameters of the randomization fraction, a and the weight, w and the sample size for the study were evaluated. When the rate of discontinuation is 0% (s=1), the sample size calculation based on Tamura and Huang (2007) gives the same results as Fava et al.'s (2003) SPCD sample size calculations. We assume p1=0.24 (response rates for AMC) and q1=0.10 to 0.15 (response rates for PLB), and s=.85 (rate of continuation). Corresponding to these, the randomization fraction a=.37 and the weight w=0.43 would maximize the power of the test. A sample size of 370 is chosen for this study and will provide 90% power to detect the weighted difference between the two treatment arms.	\N	\N	\N	\N	28	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	10	Dr. Trivedi - UT Southwestern Professor, Betty Jo Hay Distinguished Chair in Mental Health, and Julie K.

Recruitment is expected to begin on 03/01/2017 and last approximately 18 months. Each of the seven study sites is expected to randomize at least 3 participants each month. In a pilot study with similar inclusion/exclusion criteria, 49 participants were enrolled over 12 months: on average for every 9 people pre-screened, 4 passed and scheduled a consent visit, 2 attended the consent visit, and 1 was eligible to be enrolled. Study participants will be recruited using a variety of methods including flyers, mailers, billboards, television, radio, internet, social networking, and study-branded materials (e.g., ink pens, post-it notes) as well as advertising in print, electronic, and/or digital newspapers. Mailings will be sent to community agencies whose partnerships will be key to participant recruitment and retention. Secondary recruitment efforts will be targeted at the families, friends, and providers of people who use methamphetamine. The study sites should attract a diverse study population. Efforts will be made to recruit a study sample that reflects, or exceeds, the proportion of minorities in the community where the site is located. Recruitment procedures aiming to enhance enrollment of women and/or minorities will be conducted, including linkages with medical sites and/or treatment programs that serve a large number of women and/or minorities, and advertising in media outlets with high female/minority audience. Participants will not receive other formal addiction treatment services while they are participating in the study. Thus, participants must be willing to have the study intervention serve as their sole treatment during study participation. Mutual help support group attendance will be encouraged throughout the trial. Upon study completion, participants may enroll in behavioral or pharmacological addiction treatment services.	A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, prospective trial investigating dual pharmacotherapy in assisting methamphetamine addicts to stop abusing the drug.	\N	\N	\N	The study intervention consists of 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy, medical management, and medication adherence procedures. Participants randomized to the AMC treatment arm will receive an injection of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; as Vivitrol�) plus 450 mg of once-daily oral extended-release bupropion tablets (BUP-XL). Participants randomized to the PLB treatment arm will receive matched placebo in the form of injections of placebo (iPLB) plus once-daily oral placebo (oPLB) tablets. Injections of study medications (XR-NTX or iPLB) will be administered in weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Study medical clinicians will provide weekly medical management. A free medication adherence app will be provided to participants to provide study visit reminders, reminders to take study medication, and to take self-dosing videos of the oral study medication.	1	90	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	22	7	\N	1	\N	The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the AMC arm, compared to a matched placebo (PLB) arm, in reducing methamphetamine use in individuals with moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder seeking to stop or reduce methamphetamine use. The primary analysis will evaluate the impact of the AMC arm, relative to PLB, on methamphetamine use. The primary efficacy outcome is a measurement of treatment response based on methamphetamine negative urine drug screen results during the medication phase. It is hypothesized that the AMC arm will be associated with a greater number of 'responders,' defined as participants who provide a pre-specified number of MA-negative UDS tests during the evaluation period of the 12 week long medication phase, relative to the PLB arm. Secondary objectives include evaluating the effect of the AMC arm, compared to the PLB arm, on safety, other substance use outcomes, depression scores, quality of life, overall functioning, clinic attendance, and medication adherence.

This is slightly below the urate solubility threshold and this threshold has been the accepted standard for nearly all modern gout trials.47-50  Participants who achieve this endpoint will be classified as "responders."  Blood samples will be collected prior to each pegloticase infusion for measurement of sUA levels using the Beckman Coulter AU System Uric Acid procedure (see Statistical Analysis Plan for analytical details). Participants will be declared "non-responders" if there are two consecutive sUA measures > 6 mg/dL within a 48 hour period. Participants who have a single sUA >6mg/dL will be allowed to continue (per the prescribing information) and will be considered a responder. If the sUA goal is not maintained before or at the 12 week mark, it will be assumed that the participant has developed clinically relevant anti-pegloticase antibody and they will receive no further infusions.Secondary endpoints will examine anti-pegloticase Ab titers/types, different definitions of sUA level and later time points (> 12 weeks) of success, and patient reported outcomes (PROs).	7 US Academic Medical Centers with population of severe gout patients.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Estimated study duration is 27 months	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	5	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	In this proposed Phase II, double-blind, placebo controlled, multisite proof-of-concept trial in subjects initiating pegloticase for treatment of chronic refractory gout we will evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of using immune modulating therapy with MMF to prevent immunogenicity conferred by pegloticase.

Over a 2 year period 500 living kidney donations are anticipated to be performed at the 3 institutions.  80 percent (N = 400) of patients will be between 30 and 60 years of age and therefore eligible for participation in the study (Table 1 and Figure 3).      Inclusion and Exclusion criteria:  Male and female donors of any ages 30-60 years between 0 and 2 years following kidney donation.      Inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female live kidney donors; 2. Age 30 to 60 years; 3. Not currently taking 1-hydroxylated vitamin D analog. 4.  Otherwise healthy and free of disease.  Since live kidney donors undergo stringent examination to ensure normal health at the participating institutions, all live kidney donors by definition will be free of disease.    Exclusion criteria: 1. Exposure to medications known to affect bone metabolism e.g. corticosteroids within the past 3 months.  As noted above, I have kidney donors are selected for their good health.  Therefore, they will be free of disease.  However, we will specifically screen for and exclude the following:  2. Diabetes mellitus, FBG >126 mg/dL; 3. Proteinuria >3 g/24 h; 4. Vasculitis, inflammatory or neurological diseases; 5.  Vascular disease.  6. Active malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma; 7.

Participants will be randomized to groups who will receive therapy for 48 months: Group 1 (Placebo, N = 100), and Group 2 (1,25(OH)2D3, 0.25 micrograms orally once/day; N = 100) using the Simon-Pocock algorithm  balancing for age, sex and ethnicity. The rationale for the doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 to be used is that 1,25(OH)2D3 has a production rate of 1-2 mcg/ day. 1,25(OH)2D3 production in patients following living kidney donation should be equivalent to that seen in patients with CKD 3-4.  Production is reduced but not zero, and therefore 0.25 mcg/day should provide sufficient or nearly sufficient 1,25(OH)2D3 to normalize or nearly normalize 1,25(OH)2D3 levels. Doses of 0.5-4 mcg/day orally are safely used for treatment of 2o HPT in CKD/ESKD49,50. The placebo and 1,25(OH)2D3 will be prepared in the Research Pharmacy, MCR. Drs.

Skeletal health will be assessed at the time of commencement of the study and at year 4 by measuring areal bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, hip and forearm; skeletal architecture and strength by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and finite element analysis (FEA).  Serum mineral and bone biomarkers will be measured at the commencement of the study and at years 2 and 4.	\N	\N	181	\N	\N	62	\N	\N	Primary/Secondary outcomes. The main analysis will compare mean BMD at the spine, total hip and distal forearm between donor placebo and donor 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment groups.  Secondary analyses will examine the difference in cortical and trabecular thickness and bone strength between donor placebo and donor 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment groups. The main analysis will use linear regression to compare bone measures between donor placebo and donor 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment groups controlling for age, sex, and race.  Sub-analyses will investigate whether the differences between donor placebo and donor 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment groups vary by gender, and age, and will also include analyses run separately by gender.  Visual plots as well as spline fits and other diagnostics will be used to assess the fit and possible need for transformations or use of generalized linear models.   Linear regression analyses will be used to assess the associations of bone biomarker concentrations and hormonal analysis with BMD, cortical and trabecular width, and bone strength assessed by finite element analysis adjusting for age, sex and race.  Differences in the associations between the BMD, cortical and trabecular width, and bone strength and measured serum biomarkers and hormones will be assessed in the two groups and analyses will also be run separately by gender.    Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS 9 (SAS Institute), R 3.3 (http://www.R-project.org), SPSS 18.0 software (IBM Corp), and/or MedCalc 15.2.2 (MedCalc; https://www.medcalc.org/) software, or newer, and significance will be assessed at the 0.05 level.	\N	\N	\N	\N	24	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	4	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	When do you expect the first site to be initiated and how long before all sites are actively recruiting (Months-to-Activate)?  July 2019    In your estimation, how many subjects will each site enroll, on average, each month that they are open (RND/Site-Month)?    In the attached table, I show the numbers of living donor transplants performed at each of the 3 sites.  I am assuming that 50 percent of all donors from each site will be you recruited for this trial.  Therefore, at Mayo Clinic Rochester we will recruit approximately 67 patients in year 1 and an equal number in year 2.  At HCMC 5 patients will be recruited in year 1 and 5 patients will be recruited in year 2.  At the University of Minnesota, 40 patients will be recruited in year 1 and 40 patients will be recruited in year 2.  Each year, we hope to recruit about 100 patients.

It will identify healthcare system based predictors of improvement in the system's adherence to guidelines, the patients' and providers' perceptions of risks and benefits of genetic information, effective methods to communicate these results to motivate action without unintended consequences (over-diagnosis, fatalistic responses, increased stigma), and best clinical flow for genomic screening procedures.	\N	\N	39	\N	\N	22	\N	\N	Aim 1 Analyses:  The two primary outcomes are binary, i.e. whether or not each individual in the clinic population completed screening or genetic testing, and individuals are clustered within clinics.  Therefore the main analyses for this aim will be logistic regression using a mixed model that includes clinic as random effect, and intervention arm as a fixed effect.  Age and sex will also be included as person-level fixed effects. Quantitative Analyses will use quantitative scores at follow up from CFIR variables to conduct secondary analyses.  We will use simple descriptive statistics to compare overall means and standard deviations for all scale scores collected through quantitative surveys.  We will use analysis of variance with repeated measures to compare healthcare system differences. Qualitative Analysis will proceed through a series of well-used steps.  Interviews will be digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and reviewed by team members to establish familiarity with the data. An initial coding scheme will be developed based on the themes within our theoretical framework and the transcripts themselves. Additional codes will be added as needed. Two members of the research team will independently code each transcript. Coders will meet iteratively to establish inter-coder agreement. Coded data will be iteratively reviewed by the full investigative team in order to identify themes, as well as to select exemplary quotes [6,632].  Differences by participant race-ethnicity and provider and patient subgroup for each interview type will be explored  Aim 2 Analyses: We will take a systems approach to map out the clinical flow of the entire sequencing process to understand how patients move through the primary care and follow-up setting.  One important visualization tool is Value Stream Mapping (VSM), a type of flow chart that has been used in manufacturing settings to demonstrate the "lean" management concept [64]. VSM aims to identify waste and inefficiency in the system and provide optimum value to patients and healthcare providers through a value creation process. We will use VSM to identify the timing, duration and resource need at each step of the decision flow, which include scheduling of new tests, method selection, results interpretation, and information sharing with patients. Bottleneck, delays, non-value added time, and other barriers to implementation will be detected during the implementation process as areas of improvement. Another goal is to design standardized processes for incorporating genetic testing into the primary care setting for patients with different baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. A decision-analytic modeling approach will be taken to simulate the clinical flows on the population-aggregate level. This approach includes decision tree and Markov cohort simulation to project the effects of changes from before to after standardized sequencing processes.   Aim 3 Analyses: Analyses will consist of multiple regression to predict elements of clinical utility separately in patients and providers using baseline data and multiple predictors of interest.   Associated with Yij will be a vector xij of covariates for the patient (xij,patient), the provider (xij,provider),  time trends (xij,time), and the environment (xij,environment). We will model the probability of satisfaction, pr(Yij = 1) = E[Yij] = €ij, as a function of the covariates xij using regression as follows:  y(€ij) = xij,Tproviderα +  xij,Tpatientβ + xij,Ttime© + xij,Tenvironment™  Time covariates will be examined as two or four year intervals, as well as linear, quadratic or higher-order polynomials as statistically appropriate. These functions of time represent the diffusion curves. Patients within providers and regions are correlated with each other. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) [65] will take the correlation into account for the regression model. An exchangeable working correlation will be used along with the sandwich variance estimator to provide protection from misspecification of the correlation structure. General software for GEE is available in SAS PROC GENMOD.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	14	None to report	\N	\N	\N	f	If funded, the investigator is hoping to be ready in July 2019 to begin enrollment.	Compare the implementation of two strategies/methods for identifying members of a primary care clinicʼs high risk population who have a family or personal history of cancer, and encouraging these high risk individuals to obtain genetic testing for cancer susceptibility mutations.  The two methods are 1) Point of Care (POC) approach: a tablet-based screening for family/personal history of cancer will be offered to all patients aged 25-65 coming in for an appointment at the clinic.  2) Direct Patient Engagement (DPE):  Letters will be sent to all individuals aged 25-65 in a clinicʼs population, inviting them to visit a web site for screening for family/personal history of cancer.  In both groups, those determined to be high risk will then continue on with online education about genetic testing and an invitation to obtain such testing. This second step will be done on the web site.  Outcomes will be the fraction of the clinic population that participates in the family/personal screening and the fraction of the clinic population that undergoes genetic testing.	\N	\N	\N	Recruitment will be via point of care screening or letters or emails directly to the patient. Study procedures include electronic risk assessment (surveys), auto-taped interviews, genetic testing by saliva, online education.	1	398	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	Aim 1.

The study populations will of course tie to the interventions and while it is not possible to prespecify the study population precisely, in general and descriptive terms, for prevention trials, the expectation would be that the study population would likely be entirely asymptomatic, asymptomatic at risk, or in the early symptomatic stages of prodromal AD. For disease modifying therapies, the target population would likely be early AD bridging the very earliest symptomatic stages to mild severity disease. For treatments directed at symptoms of the disease, the target population would likely be mild to moderate AD, with some attention to behavioral interventions in those with moderate to severe disease including in nursing home settings.	39	As the interventions being tested within the 5-7 clinical trials are not known to the ACTC it is not possible to specify the entry criteria. In general, the criteria will be fit for purpose. For example, in the prevention trials a population of asymptomatic at risk would include those with biomarkers indicative of the presence of the underlying pathology of AD, while for mild to moderate AD, a diagnosis consistent with AD dementia, with ranges of cognitive and functional disability would define inclusion. Depending on the putative mechanism of action, there would be adjudication on the inclusion/exclusion of cerebrovascular disease, parkinsonian features and presence of lewy body features as well as frontal behavioral features.    As outlined above we will have the capability of testing across the spectrum of cognition with aging from those entirely asymptomatic for preventive interventions to those in the early symptomatic stages of AD, and then through the dementia phases to the severely affected required skilled care.	\N	At this time, the ACTC does not know the interventions that will be investigated in the 5-7 NIA funded trials that will be conducted between 2017-2022. The primary endpoint will be determined based on the trial design and the intended therapeutic effect. As we will be working across phases of development, we would generally anticipate that for phase 1 we would have safety and PK/PD as primary outcomes, For Phase 2A, the primary outcomes would be safety, PK and target engagement with evidence of  a target biomarker response. For Phase 2B, clinical proof of concept trials we would focus the primary endpoints on cognition and ADL. For phase 3 disease modifying we would be looking for cognition and ADLs benefits as primary endpoint.      For public health interventions, time to disability, dementia, cognitive decline, would be relevant primary outcomes, as would other 'time to' outcomes. We would also foresee an approach of stage gating where a cognitive benefit might be taken as the first study outcome as a stage gate to a longer term followup with more meaningful outcome in rate of functional decline, or incidence of dementia.

We intend to undertake novel designs including adaptive clinical trials, seamless phase 1-2 designs and platform trials conducted with master protocol and with shared placebo controlled arms. For the public health interventions, we will implement the most suitable outcomes and designs to test multimodal lifestyle interventions and combination approaches.

Patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and who provide informed consent will be enrolled in the study.The high prevalence of AF, the growing role of rhythm control (specifically ablation), and the distribution of risk factors in the AF population (the majority of whom have a CHADSVASC score < 4) make it likely that patients meeting the entry criteria are commonly seen in any busy EP and general cardiology practice.

Physicians will prescribe marketed NOACs, which currently include Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban and Edoxaban. The REACT AF subject population will consist of AF patients considered to be at a lower baseline risk of having a stroke, but in whom anticoagulation is still indicated by current guidelines. Only patients with a CHA2DS2-VASC score of 1- 4 (baseline stroke risk of 1.3 - 4% per year) will be eligible for this trial. Subjects enrolled will be limited to those with  non-permanent AF, no prior history of stroke or TIA, no indication for a permanent pacemaker or implantable defibrillator, and currently prescribed and taking a NOAC medication.                The study is expected to be conducted in approximately 120 centers located in the United States. Roughly 6,000 subjects will be enrolled in the study to ensure 5,260 randomized subjects. To exclude patients with a high AF burden, external ECG monitors will be used in the study to screen approximately 7,800 patients prior to enrollment and randomization (1:1) , which assumes a 30% screen fail rate. Approximately 2,630 smartwatch devices will be used in the study for subjects randomized to the treatment arm. To ensure a widespread distribution of data, minimize site bias in study results, and ensure that sites will be able to adequately manage and follow subjects enrolled in the trial, the maximum number of randomized subjects allowed at a single site is 200. The enrollment period is expected to last approximately 24 months. Subjects will be followed for 30 months and then exited. Therefore, the anticipated study duration is approximately 54 months.          Outcomes Measures: Stroke (all), systemic embolization, death, and major bleeds by ISTH criteria	\N	\N	520	\N	\N	139	\N	\N	Sample Size Determination        The sample size is determined by primary objective #2, as this objective requires the larger sample size for the two primary objectives. Details of sample size calculations are provided below for each of the study primary objectives.           Analysis Populations        The primary analysis will be conducted by intention-to-treat principles. The analysis cohort for this trial consists of all randomized subjects regardless of whether the subject received the randomly assigned treatment.           Hierarchical Testing Strategy        The conservation of type I error is desired because the study includes two primary objectives of interest. The two sets of hypotheses of interest will be tested in a hierarchical manner using a serial gatekeeping strategy.26   The hierarchy is given as follows:      1.      Primary objective #1      2.      Primary objective #2           Interim analysis        Planned interim analyses, and any unplanned interim analyses, are intended to safeguard the safety of study subjects and will be conducted under the auspices of the Data  Monitoring Committee (DMC) assigned to this study. The study will use the FDA recommended guidance entitled Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees27 to guide interim statistical analyses and DMC operations.             Sample Size Determination: Primary Objective 1 (Efficacy)    Background      The ARISTOTLE study17 was used to determine the frequency of cardiovascular death, stroke and arterial embolic events. The incidence of death, stroke, arterial embolism for those treated with apixaban was 4.49 per 100 person-years, with deaths occurring 3.52 times per 100 person-years, strokes occurring 1.19 times per 100 person-years, and arterial embolisms occurring 0.09 times per 100 person-years. Two-thirds of deaths in the study were due to cardiovascular causes.             In the ARISTOTLE study, 30% of participants had a CHADS2 score ? 3. It is estimated that approximately 15% of patients had a CHADS2 score ? 4 (corresponding to a CHA2DS2-VASc score ? 5). This estimation is based on the distribution of CHADS2 scores in Chiang C et al (2012).28 The event rates in ARISTOTLE are therefore adjusted in order to account for the lower distribution of CHA2DS2-VASc scores in REACT AF. The SPARCtool was employed to calculate the stroke risk by CHA2DS2-VASc score for patients using continuous NOAC therapy (http://www.sparctool.com/sparcnotes.htm). The overall event rate in ARISTOTLE for stroke/embolism was 1.28%. Using the SPARCtool, the average rate in the group of scores 5 or higher is 3.97%, averaged over all NOACs. Thus, the rate of stroke or arterial embolism in the range of CHA2DS2-VASc scores 4 or lower is (0.0128 - 0.0397*0.15)/0.85 = 0.00805 or            0.8% per year. Similar calculations were employed to determine the risk of stroke-related death.                 The rate of cardiovascular-related death is estimated from a subgroup analysis of the RE-LY trial.29 This subgroup analysis reported event rates for CHADS2 scores categories, choosing the categories to have an approximately equal sample size in each. The event rate is taken from the average of the 0-1 category and the 2 category. In addition, RE-LY did not report CV-related death but vascular death. Thus, this event rate is expected to be conservative. The subgroup vascular death rate is 1.55% per year in the high dose arm of the study. Using the ARISTOTLE study, 0.2% of patients with a stroke or embolism also died. Combining the ARISTOTLE and RE-LY rates together, the rate of stroke, arterial embolism, or death is 0.0155+0.008-0.002=0.0215 or 2.1% per year.                 Based on the above subset analysis from ARISTOTLE and RE-LY, we project that the primary endpoint will occur 2.1 times per 100 person years on average in randomized subjects.                 The non-inferiority margin for this objective is assumed to be an absolute risk difference of 2.5%. Previous NOAC trials, including ARISTOTLE and RE-LY, compared time to first stroke or arterial embolism using a non-inferiority margin of 1.38 and 1.46, respectively, for a hazard ratio. Here, an absolute risk difference is used to determine the non-inferiority margin for this safety endpoint rather than the hazard ratio traditionally used based on recent analysis presented in Uno H et al.  With an absolute risk difference of 2.5%, assuming that the event rate for this endpoint ranges from 2.1% to 3% per year, this margin is approximately equivalent to hazard ratios ranging from 1.35 to 1.5.  This equivalence with the hazard ratios chosen based on precedent in previous NOAC trials is the justification for the use of an absolute risk difference of 2.5%.             Sample Size Calculations        Sample size calculations were performed in PASS 2008. The allocation of study arm will be according to a 1:1 randomization schedule. A sample size is determined such that the non- inferiority of the primary objective is demonstrated and a test comparing survival curves at 30 months is used to demonstrate non-inferiority. The non-inferiority margin corresponding to an absolute risk difference of 2.5% is assumed.      The calculation further assumes a one-sided type I error rate of 0.025 and a type II error rate of 0.15 or equivalently, power of 0.85 for the final analysis. Subjects will be followed for 30 months wherever possible. The above calculation is adjusted for loss-to-follow-up, with an assumption that the loss-to-follow-up rate is 2% per year and for death due to non-cardiovascular causes, with an assumption that the non-cardiovascular death rate is 1.1% per year. The proportion of events within 30 months of follow-up for the primary endpoint is assumed, namely, 5.25% of randomized subjects. The non-inferiority margin is for this proportion is 2.5%. Thus, the non-inferiority hypothesis will require a sample size of 2940 randomized subjects. Since the superiority hypothesis described previously requires 5260 subjects, the total sample size for the study will be 5260 randomized subjects.           Analysis Methods        The primary efficacy variable will be tested with the following hypothesis:       H0:   SC(t) - ST(t) ? M for t = 30 months      HA:   SC(t) - ST(t) < M for t = 30 months        where S(t) is the survival curve for the primary endpoint at time t, and M reflects the absolute risk difference in survival curves such that M = 2.5%.               Sample Size Determination: Primary Objective 2 (safety)    Background:        The ARISTOTLE study compared apixaban to warfarin in a study of 18,201 patients with a CHADS2 score ? 1 and at least two documented episodes of AF or atrial flutter in the previous 12 months prior to enrollment.17 The incidence of major bleeding was 2.1 times per 100 person- years and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24 times per 100 person-years for those treated with apixaban.               In the ARISTOTLE study, 30% of participants had a CHADS2 score ? 3. It is estimated that approximately 15% of patients had a CHADS2 score ? 4 (corresponding to a CHA2DS2-VASc score ? 5). This estimation is based on the distribution of CHADS2 scores in Chiang C et al.28 The major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke event rates in ARISTOTLE are therefore adjusted in order to account for the lower distribution of CHA2DS2-VASc scores in REACT AF. The SPARCtool was employed to calculate the major bleeding risk by CHA2DS2-VASc score for patients using continuous NOAC therapy (http://www.sparctool.com/sparcnotes.htm). The overall event rate in ARISTOTLE for major bleeding was 2.1%. Using the SPARCtool, the average rate in the group of scores 5 or higher is 3.66%, averaged over all NOACs. Thus, the rate of major bleed in the range of 4 or lower is (0.021 - 0.0366*0.15)/0.85 = 0.0186 or 1.86% per year. The event rate for hemorrhagic stroke in ARISTOTLE is 0.24%. The hemorrhagic stroke rate is assumed to be reduced by the same proportion as the reduction in the overall stroke rate. Thus, the hemorrhagic stroke rate is 0.15% per year.               Based on the above subset analysis from ARISTOTLE, we project that the primary endpoint will occur 2.0 times per 100 person years on average in randomized subjects.           Sample Size Calculations        Sample size calculations were performed in PASS 2008. The allocation of study arm will be according to a 1:1 randomization schedule. A sample size is determined such that the superiority of the primary objective is demonstrated via a log-rank test. A reduction in major bleeding events is assumed equivalent to a hazard ratio of 0.65.      The calculation further assumes a one-sided type I error rate of 0.025 and a type II error rate of 0.15 or equivalently, power of 0.85 for the final analysis. Subjects will be followed for 30 months wherever possible. The above calculation is adjusted for loss-to-follow-up, with an assumption that the loss-to-follow-up rate is 2% per year and for death due to any cause, with an assumption that the death rate is 2.67% per year. The proportion of events within 30 months of follow-up for the primary endpoint is assumed to occur in 5% of subjects in the control arm. Thus, the superiority hypothesis will require a sample size of 5260 randomized subjects.           Analysis Methods        The primary objective will be tested with the following hypothesis:       H0:   hC(t) ? hT(t) for t ? 30 months      HA:   hC(t) > hT(t) for t ? 30 months      where h(t) is the hazard function for the primary endpoint at time t.	\N	\N	\N	\N	6	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	10	We expect to receive some or all of the needed hardware and software from Apple and Kardia. Kardia is funding a small, single site validation study with hardware, software, and technical support.

Enrolling institutions should have an active AF program and perform AF ablations. Practices consisting of at least 2 electrophysiologists will be considered. Site initiation is expected to occur over 2 years with high-volume centers initiated first. Enrollment is expected to take place over a two year period and follow-up will range from 2-3.5 years.  Based on pilot data we expect to randomize a minimum of 2 patients per site per month.	The JHU-Tufts TIC and the Vanderbilt RIC conducted an initial consult for Dr. Passman's project entitled "Rhythm Evaluation for AntiCoagulaTion for Atrial Fibrillation (REACT-AF)."  The primary aim of this proposed multicenter, prospective, non-blinded randomized controlled study is to compare rates of stroke, systemic embolization, death, and major bleeding in patients receiving chronic novel oral anticoagulation (NOAC) therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) versus those receiving time-delimited, targeted NOAC therapy guided by a continuous AF-sensing Apple Watch watchband (AliveCor).	\N	\N	\N	The intervention being used to evaluate this novel approach to anticoagulation is a modified Applewatch capable of sensing AF.  A downloaded app would allow the watch to learn a patients heart rate and heart rate variability during varying levels of activity.   If these three measures suggest the presence of atrial fibrillation for a pre-programmed duration (ie 1 hour), patients will be asked to touch the sensor on the Applewatch band that would then record a single-lead ECG which would be automatically interpreted by the Kardia software to be either normal rhythm or AF. If a threshold AF event is recorded, the patient will receive a text instructing them to restart their previously prescribed NOAC for 30 consecutive days.  Subsequent adjudication of the tracings will be performed by the treating physician during business hours.   The Kardia smartphone ECG monitor is an FDA approved medical device that is commercially available. The modified Applewatch is currently under review by the FDA and our group will be evaluating the accuracy of the AF-sensing algorithm starting May 2017 against implantable cardiac monitors.

Specific Aim 1 (Efficacy Objective)             To demonstrate that  smartwatch-guided intermittent NOAC therapy is non-inferior to continuous NOAC therapy for a composite endpoint that includes:               1.      Stroke              2.      Arterial embolism             3.      Death due to cardiovascular and unknown causes                       II.        Specific Aim 2 (Safety Objective)         To demonstrate that smartwatch-guided intermittent NOAC therapy reduces major bleeding events compared to continuous NOAC therapy.           Rationale for Primary Study Objectives     The goal of the REACT AF study is to demonstrate that smartwatch-guided, time-delimited NOAC treatment reduces the occurrence of NOAC-related major bleeding outcomes, while maintaining stroke protection and without increasing patient risk to cardiovascular events. As such, the REACT AF study has two separate objectives with two different expectations. These include: 1) an efficacy objective, aiming to demonstrate no increase in risk compared to current standard of care (continuous NOAC), and 2) a safety objective, aiming to show a reduction in major bleeding events.     To test the efficacy of smartwatch-guided time-delimited NOAC use, we will use a composite endpoint of stroke, arterial embolism, and death due to cardiovascular causes. As the standard of care, NOACs have demonstrated their ability to reduce stroke burden in AF patients by reducing cardioembolic events. Accordingly, our efficacy goal in this study is to demonstrate that the stroke risk reduction observed with NOAC use is maintained. In addition, we will include cardiovascular (CV) mortality in the efficacy endpoint to demonstrate no increase in severe cardiovascular risks. This strategy is aligned with previous IDE trials with the same objective, including the PREVAIL study that evaluated the safety of the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. Additionally, inclusion of CV mortality in our efficacy endpoint is consistent with the consensus statement on outcome parameters for trials in AF from the German Atrial Fibrillation Competence NETwork and the European Heart Rhythm Association. These groups have recommended that deaths should be included in the safety outcome for all trials in AF due to the complex consequences of this arrhythmia, and the association between AF and premature mortality.  We believe our efficacy objective can be met for two reasons: 1) patients will receive NOAC therapy when they are at risk for the types of strokes that NOACs protect against, and 2) patients may be more compliant with their NOAC regimen when only required to take NOAC as medically needed.    After demonstrating no elevated risk associated with smartwatch-guided NOAC, the second objective of this study will be to demonstrate a reduction in major bleeding risk due to the decreased time spent on NOAC. In the REACT.COM pilot study, there was a 94% reduction in the time spent on NOAC (see attachement)  providing strong evidence for the feasibility of the efficacy hypothesis in this study.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	5260	\N	\N

The trial plans to enroll 240 subjects.  Each subject will receive study drug, either hydroxychloroquine or placebo, daily for 96 weeks.  Subjects will be randomized by study site and number of existing lupus criteria that they satisfy.  Clinical and laboratory evaluations will take place every three months.     Screening data including history, physical, and laboratory analyses will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility.  Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.          The following treatment regimens will be used:           Hydroxychloroquine sulfate at 400 mg/day for subjects weighing 40 kilograms or more, and 200 mg/day for subjects weighing less than 40 kilograms.           Matching placebo - two capsules daily for subjects weighing 40 kilograms or more and one capsule/day for subjects weighing less than 40 kilograms.           Total duration of subject participation will be 104 weeks.  Subjects who meet a total of four or more SLICC classification criteria for SLE during the study will stop their participation (see section 8.6) Total duration of the study is expected to be 48 months.          The screening visit is Visit 1.  Randomization will occur at Visit 3, which will occur 4 weeks ? 3 days after Visit 1.  Visits 4-11 will occur at twelve-week intervals ? 7 days.          At approximately one-month intervals, study personnel will call each subject to reinforce compliance with study procedures.  Any potential adverse events or significant changes in the subject's medical condition will prompt an unscheduled study visit.          Unscheduled visits may be performed to document adverse events, worsening of the subject's medical condition, or withdrawal from the study.  Assessments for Unscheduled Visits are given in Section 10 and the Appendix.          Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled at study Visit 1.  Prior to that time, the participants will have had a copy of the informed consent document to review and will have had an opportunity to ask questions of the study team.  Informed Consent and Authorization for Disclosure under HIPAA will be documented before any study procedures take place.          Participants will be randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine or matching placebo at Visit 3 (week 4) using a centralized system that is stratified by treatment site and number of baseline SLICC classification criteria.  That is, ANA plus one criterion, or ANA plus two criteria.          Participants and the clinical study staff will be blinded as to which treatment is administered.  Study pharmacists at each site (if required) will also be blinded. Other personnel (study monitors, statisticians, NIAMS project officers, etc.) will remain blinded to study treatment until all subjects have completed the trial and the database is locked.          Every effort will be undertaken to maintain the blinding of study treatment.  In the event that a participant has a medical emergency the site principal investigator may break the blind.  This should be done only if it will affect the participant's immediate medical care and should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and Sponsor.  Information for un-blinding will be kept in a printed document that will be stored locked in a secure office safe in the Department of Health Sciences at Hershey and will be used by the PI with permission from the Sponsor.         Prior to conducting any study-related activities, written informed consent and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be signed and dated by the subject or subject's legal representative.  If appropriate, assent of minor participants must also be obtained prior to conducting any study-related activities.        All concomitant medication and concurrent therapies will be documented at Visit 1 (screening) and all subsequent visits.  Dose, route, frequency of administration, and indication for administration and dates of medication will be captured.         Demographic information (date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity) will be recorded at Visit 1.         Relevant medical history, including features of incomplete lupus erythematosus, and other pertinent medical conditions, and their treatment will be recorded at Visit 1.  A history of autoimmune disease in the participant's biological parents, biological siblings, and biological children will be elicited and recorded without direct identifiers.         Either the investigator or a sub-investigator who is a physician at Visits 1 and 3-11 will perform a complete physical examination.  New abnormal physical exam findings must be documented and will be followed by a physician or other qualified staff at the next scheduled visit.     Body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse will be performed after resting for 5 minutes at all visits.        At Visit 2, and again at Visit 12, participants will undergo ophthalmological examination including:       1.              Dilated fundoscopic examination (DFE)       2.              Spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT)       3.              Humphrey visual field (HVF) testing using a 10-2 pattern         At each visit, the presence or absence of clinical classification criteria for SLE set forth by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) (see Appendix) will be determined and recorded.         At each visit, the presence or absence of clinical classification criteria for SLE set forth by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (see Appendix) will be determined and recorded.         At each visit, the Modified SLEDAI-2K disease activity instrument for SLE will be determined and recorded.  The Modified SLEDAI-2K is identical to the original SLEDAI-2K, but includes the provider's global assessment (PGA) and SLE Flare Index incorporated into the document.  The period of assessment is the 30 days prior the visit as this has been effective in longitudinal studies35.         At each visit, the Cutaneous Lupus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) will be determined and recorded         At Visit 3 (Baseline), Visit 7 (Week 52) and Visit 11 (Week 100), the SLICC/ACR Damage Index will be determined and recorded.         At each visit, patient reported outcomes instruments will be administered and recorded.  These include the PROMIS 29 Adult or Pediatric Profile supplemented with additional questions from the PROMIS Fatigue item bank, and a Patient Global Visual Analogue Scale.         At Visit 1 (Screening) the CSQ will be administered and recorded.         Information regarding occurrence of adverse events will be captured throughout the study. Duration (start and stop dates), severity/grade, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug will be recorded on the case report form (CRF).         The following tests (9.3 - 9.4.6) will be performed as outlined in Section 10 and the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1)         Blood will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical hematology lab for a complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, white blood cell differential, and platelet count), and direct anti-globulin (Coombs) test.    Blood will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical chemistry lab for determination of serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, random glucose, BUN, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, calcium, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.         Blood will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical lab for determination of the blood level of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.         Blood will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical chemistry lab for determination of the serum concentration of 25-OH-vitamin D.         A urine pregnancy test will be obtained from female subjects who are of childbearing age prior to their participation in the study and at week 52.         Urine will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical laboratory for determination of color, specific gravity, pH, protein (qualitative and quantitative), glucose, ketones, blood and creatinine (quantitative).  Microscopic analysis will be performed to determine the presence of casts and cellular elements.         Blood will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical chemistry lab for determination of complement 3 (C3) and complement 4 (C4) concentrations.         Blood will be obtained and sent to a central laboratory for determination of anti-nuclear antibodies by immunofluorescence, anti-CCP 3.1, antibodies to double-stranded DNA, Ro60, Ro52, La, Sm, U1-RNP, Jo-1, centromere, histones, cardiolipin, and beta-2-glycoprotein I.         Blood will be obtained and sent to a central lab for determination of serum/plasma IgG, IgM, and IgA autoantibodies to a panel of ~100 auto-antigens using microarray methodology.         Serum levels of specific antibodies will be compared between baseline and different time points.  Levels of antibodies will be compared to the presence of clinical features of SLE.  The presence and concentration of antibodies will be correlated with treatment.         Blood will be obtained and sent to a central lab for determination of serum/plasma concentrations of ~30 cytokines and inflammatory mediators using multiplex bead technology.	\N	\N	566	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Randomization or participants will be stratified according to clinical site and number of SLICC criteria at baseline.  That is, ANA plus one additional criterion (two total) or ANA plus two additional criteria (three total).  The primary outcome variable in this double blind, randomized trial is the SLICC classification criteria count, measured every 12 weeks months over a 96-week period. Patients are eligible for the trial if they exhibit a SLICC classification criteria count of 2 or 3 at the baseline visit. Ordinal logistic regression analysis with random effects will be applied to compare the estimated slopes for the HCQ and placebo groups with respect to the SLICC classification criteria count over the 96-week follow-up period. The primary null hypothesis is that the HCQ slope equals the placebo slope, and its corresponding alternative hypothesis is that the HCQ slope does not equal the placebo slope. Thus, a two-sided test with a 0.05 significance level will be applied. The statistical model will account for the ordinal and non-decreasing properties of the SLICC classification criteria count during the 96-week follow-up period, as well as account for the repeated measurements on each patient. This statistical model will form the basis of the primary statistical analysis of the SLICC classification criteria count, as well as all secondary and subgroup analyses with the SLICC classification criteria count.          A maximum likelihood (ML) estimation will be applied for estimating all of the model parameters, namely, the intercepts, the fixed-effects parameter vector, and the variance-covariance matrix for the random effects, and apply likelihood ratio (LR) tests for testing hypotheses. Finally, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted by constructing a cell means model (a mean parameter for each time point and each treatment group, instead of a slope model) and comparing the 96-week change between the HCQ and placebo groups.          The ML estimation and LR tests are valid under a missing-at-random (MAR) mechanism. If there is reason to suspect non-ignorable missing data mechanism, then the statistical model will be expanded to be a joint model that includes (1) the ordinal logistic regression model of the SLICC repeated measurements, (2) a hazards regression model for the time-to-withdrawal, and (3) shared fixed-effects and random-effects parameters between the two models.The target sample size for this trial is 240 patients (120 randomized to each of the placebo and HCQ groups), which was calculated in the following manner. For the primary outcome variable of the SLICC classification criteria count, it is anticipated that the probability of the SLICC score progressing at least one stage during the 96-week follow-up period is 0.4 for a placebo patient, based on a composite of the pilot data and the report by Wieczorek et al. The assumption is that HCQ will be deemed clinically effective if it can reduce this probability of progression to 0.2. The sample size must be large enough such that a two-sided, 0.05 significance level test, based on the statistical analysis for the primary outcome described above, can detect this clinically meaningful effect with 90% statistical power while accounting for a 25% loss to follow-up. Because the planned statistical analysis for the primary outcome variable is rather complex, a closed-form expression for the sample size calculation is not possible. Therefore, a computer study was performed with 1,000 simulated data sets such that, on the average, one-half of the placebo patients and one-fourth of the HCQ patients progressed at least one stage with respect to the SLIC score over a 96-week period. The null hypothesis of equal placebo and HCQ slopes was rejected in 901 of the 1,000 simulated data sets (90.1% statistical power) when the sample size was 240 subjects with a 25% withdrawal rate per data set.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The recruitment plan will be approved by the IRB at each site or by the central IRB, as appropriate.  The protocol recruitment and retention officer is Dr. Mariko Ishimori.  The target population for this study is males or females with incomplete lupus in the age range 15 to 45 years, inclusive.  Since current or past treatment with hydroxychloroquine is not permitted, most recruitment efforts will be focused on new patient referrals at each site.  Each site will be encouraged to develop approaches to identify these patients such as through triage systems for new consultation requests, local advertising, contact with local support groups as well as through social media.  With IRB approval, electronic medical records also may be used to screen potential subjects who are scheduled for the rheumatology clinics at each institution.           Each site will generate and maintain a list of candidate patients based on referral and chart information.  Rheumatology clinicians at each site will be made aware of the study and the recruitment efforts.  Patients may be given a 'permission to notify' letter by their personal rheumatologist, which will allow study staff to contact the individual after a clinic visit by telephone.  The study coordinator may then contact this person by phone and use an IRB-approved script to describe the study to the patient.  If the patient wishes to receive more information, then a consent form may be mailed to their home.   If the patient wishes to make an appointment for screening, the coordinator will be ready with a calendar of available dates to accommodate that request.            Written informed consent is obtained by the site investigator or study coordinator at each site.  No study-related events will take place until signed informed consent has been obtained.          Retention of study subjects in a 24-month trial is critical to study success.  The study is designed to have a statistically significant outcome with at least 75% retention.  The importance of follow-up and completion will be emphasized to the patient at the time of consent.   Study candidates in whom other events that might interfere with participation are planned, such as surgeries, relocations or travel, will be encouraged to consider enrollment only after these take place.  Study coordinators will collect more than one contact phone number (i.e. home, work, mobile) when available, and will also request contact information for another person such as a parent as a backup in the event of communications interruptions.  Investigators and coordinators will be encouraged to be alert to any logistic problems such as parking or unexpected travel expense that might be remediable in order to retain a patient in the study.  Study coordinators will contact each enrolled patient once by phone approximately midway between the 3-month scheduled follow-up visits to review any new issues and to remind the patient about study compliance.  Recruitment and retention status reports will be prepared and presented to the Executive Committee by Dr. Ishimori as part of the regular monthly phone conference.	\N	\N	\N	\N	The following treatment regimens will be used:       Hydroxychloroquine sulfate at 400 mg/day for subjects weighing 40 kilograms or more, and 200 mg/day for subjects weighing less than 40 kilograms.        Matching placebo - two capsules daily for subjects weighing 40 kilograms or more and one capsule/day for subjects weighing less than 40 kilograms.         Total duration of subject participation will be 104 weeks.  Subjects who meet a total of four or more SLICC classification criteria for SLE during the study will stop their participation (see section 8.6) Total duration of the study is expected to be 48 months.	\N	108	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	5	\N	1	\N	1.To carry out a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized trial of HCQ vs. placebo in patients with ILE.  The study tests the hypothesis that early use of HCQ can modify disease features so that accumulation of abnormalities leading to a classification of SLE can be significantly slowed.           The primary endpoint is the increase in clinical and laboratory disease features of SLE defined by the 2012 SLICC classification criteria between month 0 and month 24 .         2. To determine effects of HCQ on disease activity and patient-reported outcomes in patients with ILE. The outcome is the change in score for the PROMIS 29 Adult Profile supplemented with additional fatigue questions from the PROMIS item bank along with a Visual Analog Scale.           3. To characterize the immunologic profile of HCQ in ILE-treated patients.   Autoantibodies, cytokines and chemokines will be measured on multiplex arrays to develop insights into underlying mechanisms.The outcome is the change in autoantibodies determined by a 125 antigen microarray, and soluble mediators determined by solid phase immunoassay.          4.To quantitatively assess the incidence of ophthalmologic toxicity in HCQ-treated ILE patients.  All enrolled patients will have standardized ophthalmologic examinations before and after study treatment.  Recommendations for use and monitoring in this patient population will be developed.    Using a standardized reporting template, changes in dilated fundoscopic exam, spectral domain ocular coherence tomography, and Humphrey Visual Field testing will be qualified before and after exposure to hydroxychloroquine or placebo.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	240	\N	\N

We anticipated screening approximately 4400 patients with ESUS, of whom we anticipated ~25% would meet on of the three biomarker criteria for atrial cardiopathy. Enrolment began in February 2018. Of the first 150 patients consented and screened, 64 have been eligible (43%). Patients are being recruited from 120 hospitals participating in the NIH StrokeNet consortium; 67 sites are already recruiting, and the remaining 53 sites are completing paperwork.   Inclusion or exclusion of subjects will not differ based on sex/gender, and the aim is to recruit similar numbers of men and women. The absence of an upper age limit will aid recruitment of women given that they are generally older than men at the time of a first cardiovascular event such as stroke.  Inclusion or exclusion of subjects will not differ based on race/ethnicity. To ensure representative enrollment of minority groups, site PIs and their clinical research staff have been trained and are periodically reminded to:  •\tBe mindful of cultural, historical, social, and political factors that may influence minority participation. It should be noted that many individuals (particularly certain racial/ethnic groups) need clarification on what a clinical trial is; understanding of what type of research is being conducted; who is conducting the research study, benefits to individuals and the community; place of worship's encouragement, etc.  •\tEmphasize that the goal is to recruit patients regardless of race or ethnicity.  •\tClearly explain that the purpose of informed consent is to protect, not relinquish, participants' rights.  •\tProvide time if necessary between screening and randomization for patients to reflect and discuss participation with family.  •\tEmphasize the proven track record of the study drugs.  •\tEmphasize the trial's potential to help find better treatments to prevent stroke.  •\tMitigate concern about randomization by clearly explaining its rationale and highlighting the possibility of cross over if clinically indicated.  •\tEmphasize that participants will be kept up to date on scientific developments in this field throughout their participation in the trial.  •\tThink about modes of communication for outreach and retention, such as follow-up phone calls, social media campaigns, text messaging, to identify what works best for the community/population (as allowed by local regulations).  •\tProvide translation services or bilingual staff, if needed for recruiting populations for which English is not the primary language.  •\tUse motivational interviewing techniques as a method to improve communication between the research coordinator and patient population to enhance recruitment efforts. This includes investigators and staff taking the time to understand the patient's personal circumstances that may well affect enrollment and follow-up.	39	Inclusion criteria  •\tAge >=45 years.  •\tClinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke + brain imaging to rule out hemorrhagic stroke.  •\tModified Rankin Scale (MRS) score <=4.  •\tAbility to be randomized no later than 120 days after stroke onset.   •\tESUS, defined as all of the following:  -\tStroke that is not lacunar.   -\tAbsence of extracranial or intracranial atherosclerosis causing ≥50% luminal stenosis of the artery supplying the area of ischemia.   -\tNo major-risk cardioembolic source of embolism, including AF, intracardiac thrombus, mechanical prosthetic cardiac valve, atrial myxoma or other cardiac tumors, mitral stenosis, myocardial infarction within the last 4 weeks, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%, valvular vegetations, or infective endocarditis).   -\tNo other specific cause of stroke identified, such as arteritis, dissection, migraine, vasospasm, drug abuse, or hypercoagulability.

There are 120 sites, all of which are participating in the NIH (NINDS) funded StrokeNet consortium.  the StrokeNet consortium is composed of 25 regional coordinating centers (RCCs) each of which has responsibility for several satellite sites. There are a total of more than 300 satellite hospitals participating in the network, and we sent site selection surveys to all sites to determine which ones would be interested in participating, have the proper resources, and also to determine the likely numbers of eligible patients at their sites. We were able to use data from their recruitment success in other similar trials in some instances. We selected 120 sites, and we have a waitlist of 10-20 sites as well. RCCs are responsible for some oversight of the sites in their regional network. Sites are located throughout the US; we have no international sites.	\N	\N	\N	\N	60 months	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	It is known that anticoagulation with apixaban reduces risk of recurrent stroke in patients with stroke and atrial fibrillation (AF), but approximately 30% of strokes are of unknown cause and AF may remain undetected. The purpose of this trial is to determine whether anticoagulation with apixaban will reduce risk of recurrent stroke in these patients similarly to its effect in AF. Atial cardiopathy is defined based on presence of one of three biomarkers of atrial dysfunction (PTFV1 >5,000 μV*ms on 12-lead ECG; serum NT-proBNP >250 pg/mL; or left atrial diameter index ≥3 cm/m2 on echocardiogram (severe left atrial enlargement).	\N	\N	83	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Statistical analysis details are documented in a formal statistical and analytical plan (SAP).   Primary efficacy endpoint: The null hypothesis (H0) is that the hazard ratio comparing apixaban versus aspirin for the primary endpoint will be 1.  Secondary efficacy endpoint: The null hypothesis (H0) is that the hazard ratio comparing apixaban versus aspirin for the secondary endpoint will be 1.  The analysis datasets will include:  •\tIntention-to-treat analysis dataset, which will include all randomized participants.  •\tSafety analysis dataset, which will include all participants who took at least one dose of study drug.  •\tPer-protocol analysis dataset, which will include all randomized participants who do not have an eligibility violation and who received at least one dose of study drug.    Efficacy outcomes will be analyzed in the intention-to-treat analysis dataset. Safety outcomes will be analyzed in the safety analysis dataset.  The log-rank statistic will be used to test the null hypothesis that the hazard ratio is 1, comparing apixaban to aspirin, at a two-tailed alpha level of 0.05.  A standard frequency table will be used to report the number (%) of SAEs, stratified by treatment group.   Log-rank tests will be utilized to assess the treatment group differences in the rates of: (1) first symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage; (2) first major hemorrhage other than intracranial hemorrhage; and (3) death from any cause.   The ARCADIA investigators propose one interim analysis for efficacy (or harm) and futility to be performed when 1/2 of the expected events have occurred (75 events), with the details specified in the SAP.    The primary efficacy and safety analyses will be stratified by age (<75 years versus ≥75 years), sex/gender, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white versus others). Differential effects of apixaban versus aspirin across these subgroups are not anticipated and therefore the trial is not powered specifically for these subgroup analyses, but these analyses will allow any unexpectedly large variations to be identified.  The SAP lists additional prespecified exploratory and sensitivity analyses, including analyses related to the secondary objective of the trial, which is to test the hypothesis that the relative efficacy of apixaban over aspirin increases with the severity of atrial cardiopathy.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The ARCADIA trial is being funded by the NIH/NINDS (U01 NS095869; MPI Elkind/Kamel/Longstreth/Tirschwell).

Our target is 120 sites. We anticipated consenting and screening for biomarkers 4 patients with unexplained stroke for every one patient that would be eligible for randomization (25% eligibility for randomization). Among the 155 patients consented and screened thus far, 66 (approximately 43%) have been eligible for randomization, and 45 have been randomized. There is a delay between determination of eligibility for randomization and randomization; patients must be randomized within 120 days of their stroke, but patients may have randomization delayed if the stroke is large, they are sent to rehabilitation, additional diagnostic testing is being performed, or for other reasons.   As of July 16, 2018 we have 101 sites that have executed their clinical trial agreements, 88 that have received central IRB approval, 83 that have received study drug, 75 that had had site readiness calls, and 74 that have been released to enroll participants. Of the 74 sites released to enroll, 44 have consented at least one patient for biomarker screening, and 30 have not consented any patients yet. Of those that have not consented anyone yet, 5 were released to enroll approximately 3 months ago, and 1 was released 4 months ago. Our contract states that sites that have not randomized any patients in a three month period will be placed on probation.  We have 5 VA sites participating as well; they have a different IRB approval process. Once they are approved centrally, we expect them to be and running fairly quickly.   Our initial target for enrollment was 440 patients randomized per year X 2.5 years to achieve our full sample size of 1100. Site activation and recruitment per site has been slower than anticipated. At our present rate of about 4 sites released to enroll per week, we anticipate all 120 sites (another 46) to be up and running by November 1, 2018. Once all sites are active, we anticipate each one will consent 16 patients per year and randomize 4 per year; thus they should each be randomizing 0.33 patients per month. Our present rate among the 74 sites up and running is 0.25 patients per site per month, with a wide range from 0 to 2.0 patients per month. At our current rate it will take about 3.5 years to recruit, a full year longer than projected. Our recruitment goal is important both for power and for feasibility since we do not want study duration to extend too long as it requires patients to take medication for a long period and the medication is also costly.  The study protocol and a recruitment brochure are attached.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Study treatments to be administered are active apixaban or matching placebo and active aspirin or matching placebo. Blinding will be provided by the use of the same color of formulations, same drug packaging, and same method of drug administration in every subject.  Active treatment will be either apixaban 5 mg or aspirin 81 mg. An adjusted dose of apixaban 2.5 mg will be used for subjects with 2 of the following: age 80 years, body weight 60 kg, or known serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL. Thus, there will be six possible study tablets: apixaban 5 mg (regular dose), apixaban 2.5 mg (adjusted dose), apixaban 5 mg placebo, apixaban 2.5 mg placebo, aspirin 81 mg, and aspirin placebo. This dosing schema is consistent with previous trials of stroke prevention in AF.21,32 Aspirin will be used as the active control agent since it is the proven, standard-of-care antithrombotic drug recommended for patients with stroke.   Study drug and matching placebo will be supplied by the BMS-Pfizer Partnership. Study drug will be sent from BMS-Pfizer to the StrokeNet Central Pharmacy, which will label the study drug bottles, distribute study drug to the sites as they are released to enroll, and resupply sites with study drug as recruitment progresses.	1	371	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	120	\N	\N	\N	•\tPrimary: To test the hypothesis that apixaban is superior to aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke and atrial cardiopathy.  •\tSecondary: To test the hypothesis that the relative efficacy of apixaban over aspirin increases with the severity of atrial cardiopathy.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	25	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	1100	\N	\N

The study population will be composed of pregnant women of mixed parity (nulliparous and multiparous) who have a moderate quantity of prenatal risk for cesarean delivery as measured by the modified published AMOR-IPAT risk scoring system. It is assumed that the study population will come from the general population of the investigational sites involved with the study. The study will, by intention, recruit subjects with a balanced mix of subject features (parity, race, ethnicity and insurance status). Monitoring of characteristics of randomized subjects will be used to guide subsequent enrollment, especially towards the end of the study. The greatest emphasis of study balance will be on parity status and race.        The intent of the study is to enroll a group of pregnant patients who have moderate levels of prenatal risk for cesarean delivery. As such, the study population will not include subjects with minimal risk for cesarean delivery, and will not include subjects who, at 37 weeks 4 days, have developed an accepted 'indication' for delivery prior to 40 weeks of gestation.  It is assumed that all study sites will recruit subjects equally from all clinical sites as directed by the IRB of each site.	41	Exclusion criteria for this study include:        Multiples (twins, triplets, etc.), 2) Ineligible for trial of labor (Prior cesarean delivery or transmural uterine incision, uterine anomaly, etc.), 3) Persistent malpresentation (breech or transverse), 4) HIV infection, 5) Age < 18 years, 6) Uncertain pregnancy dating, including lack of dating ultrasound prior to 20 weeks of gestation.        Thereafter, inclusion criteria will be based on the use of the published AMOR-IPAT risk scoring system. Subjects will be eligible for possible inclusion into this study if their pregnancy has an estimated UL-OTD that is less than 40 weeks 0 days of gestation.

The most important feature of an outcome like the mWAOI Score is that it provides a summary measure of the variety of adverse outcomes that can occur with delivery. In addition, the mWAOI score uses a weighting system wherein adverse outcomes that are more unfavorable are given more value than outcomes that - while unfavorable - are less so. Finally, the use of a composite outcome is advantageous because its structure increases the power of statistical comparisons between various groups and sub-groups within the study. The use of the mWAOI Score would increase the ability to determine whether or not there was an improvement in overall childbirth health following the use of any given care strategy.

The trial will involve 5 sites        The 5 sites will be:        Penn State Hershey/Harrisburg Hospital/York Hospital/Good Samaritan Hospital    Washington University    University of Oregon    UNC/Duke    University of Texas (Galveston)             The study will recruit women who are pregnant between 28 and 37 weeks of gestation who have a moderate level of risk as estimated by the AMOR-IPAT risk-scoring system. Specifically patients will be eligible to enroll in the study of their UL-OTD is less than 40 weeks 0 days. The study will seek to recruit 1500 nulliparous and 1500 multiparous pregnant women.        Women recruited into the study who remain pregnant at 36 weeks 6 days of gestation will be randomized equally to one of the three arms of the study.         Subject treatment based on study group:    1. Following randomization, subjects randomized to the AMOR-IPAT arm will be informed of their estimated UL-OTD and will be offered induction of labor date 1-3 days prior to their estimated UL-OTD.    2. Following randomization, subjects randomized to '39-week induction of labor' will be informed of their study group and will scheduled for a planned induction of labor no more than 3 days after reaching 39 weeks 0 days of gestation.    3. Following randomization, subjects randomized to '40-week induction of labor' will be informed of their study group and will scheduled for a planned induction of labor no more than 3 days after reaching 40 weeks 0 days of gestation.    4. Following randomization, subjects randomized to the current standard of care ('CSOC') will be informed of their study group and will scheduled for a planned induction of labor no more than 3 days after reaching 41 weeks 0 days of gestation.          All subjects will have a cervical examination in the 37th week of gestation to determine the need for cervical ripening prior to induction. Cervical ripening and labor induction will follow local standards for all study subjects, irrespective of study group assignment.          Clinical outcomes, and details of the course pre-delivery, delivery and post-partum care for mother and baby (including charges incurred for care), will be obtained for every pregnancy. The main study outcome will be the modified adverse outcome index score (mWAOI score). Secondary outcomes will include rates of uncomplicated delivery rate, cesarean delivery rate, and NICU admission, as well as neonatal respiratory status and overall all cost of care.	\N	\N	649	\N	\N	112	\N	\N	The statistical plan will initially include comparison of the basic make-up of all four study groups (and important sub-groups) as well as comparison of the clinical courses of subjects in the different areas of hospital care: clinical findings at the time of admission, mode of labor onset, details about cervical ripening and labor induction, and delivery information. Analysis will also include the comparison of data concerning the post-delivery course of mothers and baby in each group (and important sub-groups).  Due to concerns about pre-39 week delivery, a special emphasis will be placed on the measurement of neonatal outcomes in general and neonatal pulmonary health in particular.         The primary outcome for this study will be the mWAOI Score. Every pregnancy in the study will have its own mWAOI score. It is assumed that subjects in each study group will have a relatively continuous but non-parametric distribution of individual mWAOI scores within each group. The distribution of mWAOI Scores in each group will be compared with every other study group using non-parametric techniques. This will initially mean the use of simple Wilcoxon Rank-Sum testing followed by the use of stratified Wilcoxon testing to adjust for the presence of important covariates (i.e., parity status, race, ethnicity, insurance status).        The mWAOI Scores are predicted to have mean values significantly higher than WAOI scores because cesarean delivery is a relatively common adverse outcome and complicated NICU admission is a fairly common adverse outcome. A sample size of 143 per group will provide 80% power to detect a reduction of mWAOI Score from 12 to 6 between two treatment groups, assuming the standard deviation is 17.5 points, using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test having a significance level of 0.05. Such a reduction is expected for the comparison between AMOR-IPAT vs. CSOC. However, less treatment effect is predicted for the comparison between AMOR-IPAT and IOL-40, and even less for AMOR-IPAT vs. IOL-39. It is anticipated that a sample size of 250 per group will adequately power all comparisons.        Rates of dichotomous adverse outcomes will also be determined for each study group (and important sub-groups) and compared. Standard techniques using unadjusted comparison of rates will be used, followed by adjusted comparisons using logistic regression.        In addition, the study plans to collect qualitative data from both providers and patients about their satisfaction with the clinical course of each term pregnancy. These data will be collected through a series of short simple questionnaires.        Finally, the study will collect financial information as reflected in charges for term pre-hospital clinical activity and charges for maternal and neonatal care. Charge rather than payment data will be used to avoid the potential impact of variable insurance payment agreements. It is expected that the charges for each pregnancy within each group will be continuous and non-parametric in nature. Means, medians and standard distribution will be determined for each study group, but the groups (and important sub-groups [e.g., maternal care charges, neonatal care charges]) will be compared using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum testing methods.	\N	\N	f	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	359	The principal investigator of this proposal is affiliated with the Star Legacy Foundation.

Problems with subject enrollment were not encountered during the AMOR-IPAT RCT performed at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006-2007, and the ongoing NICHD-MFMU 'ARRIVE' Trial is not encountering problems with subject enrollment. Enrollment will not be unusually difficult because it is common knowledge that many women develop a syndrome called 'tired of pregnancy' in the mid to late 3rd trimester. This means that the last month or two of pregnancy can be rather uncomfortable, and many women are interested in finding ways to deliver 'sooner rather than later'. Enrollment in this study would offer a relatively high chance of delivery at or prior to a pregnancy's due date, and that would be appealing to many pregnant women. An increasing amount of data is accumulating that suggests that delivery in the 39th week provides better outcomes than expectant management to a later gestational age. Hence, it appears that enrollment in this study will be both appreciated and relatively safe for mother and baby. Preliminary evidence suggests that exposure to AMOR-IPAT for patients with fairly high levels of cumulative prenatal risk for cesarean delivery - even with its recommendation for planned delivery prior to 39 weeks 0 days of gestation - might be safer than routine delivery in the 39th or 40th week.        It is assumed that this will be a 3-year study. Six months are budgeted for start-up and IRB approval activities. Two full years are budgeted for subject accrual, delivery and data collection. Six months are budgeted for final data collection, study close-out, data analysis and generation of manuscripts to report study findings.                               1st half                  2nd half                 1st half                 2nd half           1st half             2nd half  Site                           1st Year                  1st Year                 2nd Year              2nd Year          3rd Year           3rd Year                           Start-up                  70 enrolled           70 enrolled          70 enrolled     70 enrolled      Close-out  Site #1                            IRB                       50 delivered        50 delivered       50 delivered    50 delivered       Analysis                             Start-up                  70 enrolled           70 enrolled          70 enrolled     70 enrolled      Close-out  Site #2                             IRB                       50 delivered        50 delivered       50 delivered    50 delivered       Analysis                             Start-up                  70 enrolled           70 enrolled          70 enrolled     70 enrolled      Close-out  Site #3                                IRB                       50 delivered        50 delivered       50 delivered    50 delivered       Analysis                             Start-up                  70 enrolled           70 enrolled          70 enrolled     70 enrolled      Close-out  Site #4                             IRB                       50 delivered        50 delivered       50 delivered    50 delivered       Analysis                              Start-up                  70 enrolled           70 enrolled          70 enrolled     70 enrolled      Close-out  Site #5                               IRB                       50 delivered        50 delivered       50 delivered    50 delivered       Analysis                                                              350 enrolled       350 enrolled      350 enrolled     350 enrolled       1400 enrolled  TOTALS                                                          250 delivered     250 delivered     250 delivered   250 delivered     1000 delivered	Brief Description:  The goal of this project is to provide a personalized medicine approach to labor induction by finding the upper  limit of the optimal time of delivery (UL-OTD) using Active Management of Risk in Pregnancy at Term  (AMOR-IPAT).  Aim 1 is to determine if the use of AMOR-IPAT will lead to improved childbirth outcomes as compared to  more standard and less personalized approaches to term pregnancy management.  Aim 2 is to identify rate of important specific solitary clinical outcomes (Cesarean, NICU admission, major  perineal trauma, excessive bleeding).  Aim 3 is to determine the relative cost of the methods of care - as measured in medical charges.  Aim 4 is to determine patient and provider satisfaction scores.      UPDATE March 2018:   1)\tTo measure, in multiparas, the impact of risk-based early-term labor induction, as compared to expectant management until at least 40 weeks 0 days of gestation, on common maternal childbirth complications (cesarean delivery, major perineal trauma, hemorrhage). The optimal timing of delivery will be estimated using a published paradigm called the Active Management of Risk in Pregnancy at Term (AMOR-IPAT). [citation]  2)\tTo measure, in the fetuses/infants of multiparas, the impact of risk-based early-term labor induction, as compared to expectant management until at least 40 weeks 0 days of gestation, on common fetal/infant complications (neonatal injury, respiratory insufficiency, neonatal sepsis, stillbirth).	\N	\N	\N	AMOR-IPAT uses a risk scoring system to estimate, for every pregnancy, an upper limit of the optimal time of delivery (UL-OTD). The more risk a pregnancy has for cesarean delivery - and presumably other adverse birth outcomes - the lower the UL-OTD. Once an estimate of the UL-OTD for a given pregnancy is determined the patient is offered labor induction so that labor and delivery can be guaranteed to occur on or just before the pregnancy's UL-OTD. In reality, any given pregnancy might develop spontaneous labor prior to its UL-OTD and therefore labor induction would not be needed. However, groups of pregnancies exposed to AMOR-IPAT always have a higher rate of IOL than groups of pregnancies exposed to more usual strategies of term pregnancy management.         Inherent in the use of AMOR-IPAT is the regular use of cervical ripening agents prior to the onset of the labor induction. There are a variety of pharmacologic products and mechanical devices that have, over the past 20 years, significantly improved the safety and effectiveness of cervical ripening and labor induction. These agents will be used on a regular basis in all study groups when subjects are scheduled for labor induction but require cervical ripening.         Also inherent in the use of AMOR-IPAT is the regular use of risk-based but 'non-indicated' labor induction in the 38th week of gestation. The use of 'non-indicated' labor induction prior to 39 weeks of gestation is currently restricted throughout the USA because of concerns about neonatal morbidity related to 'early-term' delivery. However, those concerns are based primarily on observational studies that contain identifiable flaws. AMOR-IPAT recommends pre-39 week IOL only in pregnancies with fairly high levels of cumulative risk for cesarean delivery. In addition, the neonatal outcomes of pregnancies exposed to AMOR-IPAT that underwent risk-based IOL prior to 39 weeks were superior to the neonatal outcomes of CSOC pregnancies that were expectantly managed beyond 39 weeks 0 days of gestation. Hence, the part of AMOR-IPAT that involves pre-39 weeks risk-based but 'non-indicated' IOL appears to be both beneficial and safe.         For the IOL-39 study group, subjects will be scheduled for induction within 3 days of reaching 39 weeks 0 days of gestation         For the IOL-40 study group, subjects will be scheduled for induction within 3 days of reaching 40 weeks 0 days of gestation.         For the CSOC study group, subjects will be scheduled for induction within 3 days of reaching 41 weeks 0 days of gestation.	3	78	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	75	5	\N	1	\N	The primary aim of this study is to answer a basic obstetrical question: How do childbirth outcomes resulting from the exposure of term pregnancies with moderate levels of prenatal risk to AMOR-IPAT compare with childbirth outcomes resulting from exposure to the more standard strategies of term pregnancy management (i.e., CSOC, IOL-39, and IOL-40)?        The small AMOR-IPAT RCT reported relatively strong improvements in childbirth outcomes following the regular use of risk-based by 'non-indicated' IOL. Additional data on the relative risks and benefits of AMOR-IPAT are clearly needed. The primary endpoint will be the modified Weighted Adverse Outcome Index Score (mWAOI Score).                 The study will have four secondary aims:      1. To determine possible variations in the impact of exposure to AMOR-IPAT as a function of parity status (nulliparous vs. multiparous);    As noted above, nulliparous and multiparous pregnancy are different in clinically meaningful ways and the impact of AMOR-IPAT on both types of pregnancy needs to be studied. Outcome: mWAOI Score.      2. To determine possible variations in the impact of the regular use of AMOR-IPAT as a function of basic demographic variables (Caucasian vs. African American; Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic; private insurance vs. Medicaid);    Methods of term pregnancy care involving a variable use of IOL and that are guided by gestational age might have outcomes that differ depending on subject race, ethnicity or insurance status. Outcome: mWAOI Score.      3. To determine possible variations in childbirth outcomes between the three more accepted strategies of term pregnancy management;    There are no published RCT's that have compared CSOC to IOL-39 or IOL-40. Outcome: mWAOI Score.         4. To determine the relative cost of the four methods of care - as measured in medical charges.     If AMOR-IPAT leads to fewer post-partum complications, then a decrease in the cost of post-partum care might more than offset the increase cost of more frequent IOL. Outcome: charge data for care.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1000	\N	\N

Specific Aim 1: Determine the pathogen genetic factors associated with the outcome.   We will prospectively collect intraocular biopsy samples from 150 patients diagnosed with post-surgical endophthalmitis. We will collect extensive clinical data at baseline, week 1, and month 1. We will perform whole-genome DNA sequencing (WGS) of the intraocular samples, identify and molecularly characterize the causative pathogen, and catalogue the strain variants that exist for each pathogen to determine whether these factors correlate with outcome.     Specific Aim 2: Determine the host gene expression features associated with the outcome.   We will perform RNA-seq in all collected endophthalmitis (n=180) and 30 control samples. Once RNA-seq is performed, human and non-human sequences will be separated and analyzed in Aim 2 and 3, respectively. We will characterize the host gene expression profile to determine whether these correlate with outcome.

Aim 1.3) Assuming the laboratory tested antibiotic resistance profile as the gold standard, we will test the sensitivity and specificity of the antibiotic resistance genomic profile from WGS. We will also test whether particular antibiotic resistance genes are associated with worse clinical outcome (VA <20/200) with multivariate logistic regression.    Aim 2.1) We will determine the host gene expression profile associated with month 1 VA resolution. Aim 2.2) We will determine the host gene expression profile that distinguishes culture-positive from culture-negative endophthalmitis. Aim 2.3.) We will evaluate the effect of TTV in host gene expression profile by investigating whether certain host gene expression is associated with TTV. We will use global bootstrapped Monte Carlo rank order permutation testing to identify the significance of a combination of genes that may be associated with outcomes in Aim 2.1-2.3.    Aim 3.1) We will test whether Staph epi has signature transcription profiles that are associated with better (month 1 VA <20/200) or worse visual outcome. We will analyze all the non-ribosomal protein coding genes that have more than 100 average reads. We will determine whether there is a significant difference in the combination of genes between two visual outcome groups with RNA-seq differential expression package DESeq2.

0	f	2	\N	\N	t	3 months	Three hundred patient sample size.  Prior studies of vestibular rehabilitation have shown a benefit relative to placebo with as few as 40 patients.  We plan to enroll more than this because home based vestibular rehabilitation programs have historically been less effective.  One such study which demonstrated a significant but modest effect enrolled 240 patients, thus if an effect cannot be shown in a study that size it is likely that the effect is not clinically significant.  In the one prior study that measured compliance with a home vestibular rehabilitation technique it was poor (<50%). This compliance rate is worse than is typical of medication based trials but is also consistent with our preliminary experience with the AVR.  Thus a larger enrollment is needed to make up for poor compliance.  It is expected that about 60% (180 patients) will make it through the run in period and become randomized (90 per group).  An additional 20% may drop out during testing leaving 76 patients in each group.  It has previously been reported that a DHI score of 18 points with a test score standard deviation (SD) of 24 points, or a 42% change from the pre-treatment level is a minimal clinically important difference.  In this study the minimum baseline DHI is 30 thus a 42% decrease would correspond to a 13 point change.  A sample size of 75 subjects per group will provide a 90% power to detect a group difference in mean DHI of 13 points, assuming a standard deviation of 24 points with a two-sided alpha=0.05.    We imagine an even gender distribution, including patients age 18-80.  Geographic locations will depend on the sites that can provide the necessary population.	45	Inclusion criteria  1.  Age between 18 and 79.  2.  A significant vestibular hypofunction of at least 25% on caloric testing  3.  A total DHI score of ≥30 with dizziness or imbalance symptoms that are likely to be caused by UVH.  4.  Must have internet access.    Exclusion Criteria:  1.  Diagnosis of Meniere's as defined by the criteria established by the American Academy of Otolaryngology with vertigo attacks in the past three months or have not been definitively treated with gentamicin or labyrinthectomy.  2.  Active benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) defined as a positive Dix-Halpike test.  3.  Symptoms exacerbated by visual motion or computer use (such symptoms are common in migraine).  4.  A physical condition which precludes participation (e.g. blindness, poor muscle control).  5.  Plans to complete another vestibular rehabilitation program (e.g. other than the study and the home based exercises provided)  6.  The patient is unwilling or unable to comply with the study requirements.	\N	The DHI is used as the primary outcome because it is likely to be the most direct and validated measure of dizziness symptoms.   In addition to looking for a statistically significant improvement, we want to look for a clinically significant improvement.  This has previously been establishes as a 42% decrease or 22 points.	The number of sites will depend on how many patients each site can provide.

Patients with UVD who meet the entry criteria will be enrolled and given the AVR device in addition to instructions on standard vestibular rehabilitation exercises.  During a 1 week run-in period prior to randomization the participants will complete a static visual acuity task.  This task involves reporting the orientation of an optotype (a Landolt-C, essentially a circle with a gap in it) while both the head and optotype remain stationary.  The purpose of this run-in period is to allow people the opportunity to get used to the equipment and also determine the stability of symptoms prior to therapy(DHI will be measured at enrollment and at the end of the week, a visual analog scale will be used daily).  This period will also allow subjects to drop out prior to randomization which should improve data quality by decreasing the number of drop outs after randomization.  In the preliminary studies about half of patients who were eligible completed one or fewer sessions.  After the run-in period patients will be randomized to either a placebo or the AVR task.  The placebo task involves having subjects hold their head still while reporting the orientation of a moving optotype.  This has previously been shown not to be of value.  The randomization can be performed remotely through the web-based software.  As with the run-in period the DHI will be measured weekly and daily (when the subjects login) they will complete the visual analog scale and also report whether they did the standard vestibular rehabilitation exercises that day.  The trial will persist for 4 weeks.  At the end patients who were given the placebo task will be given the opportunity to do the AVR if they wish.	\N	\N	458	\N	\N	92	\N	\N	The primary statistical analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle and will include all available data from all randomized subjects, regardless of compliance with the assigned treatment.  Every effort will be made to retain subjects in this study, to promote adherence to the study protocol, and to collect all data at every visit.  If a subject cannot tolerate or refuses to continue study treatment, we will continue to follow and evaluate that subject if he/she is willing.  If a subject withdraws from the study, attempts will be made to bring the subject in for a final evaluation.  Compliance with study procedures and reasons for subject withdrawal will be tracked throughout the study.  The primary statistical analysis will involve the use of a repeated measures analysis of covariance model (i.e., the so-called "mixed model repeated measures", or MMRM, analysis strategy) There will be terms for treatment group, age, site, baseline DHI score, time (treated as a categorical variable), and interaction terms for baseline DHI score and time and for treatment group and time.  The covariance matrix for the within-subject observations will be modeled using an unstructured pattern.  Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for treatment effects (differences in adjusted group means) at each weekly assessment will be computed using this model, with the Week 4 time point being of primary interest.  A test for significance of the treatment effect at Week 4 will likewise be performed with this model using a significance level of 5% (two-tailed).  \tAnalysis of the secondary outcomes for efficacy will involve fitting analysis of covariance models with treatment group as the factor of interest, site as a stratification factor, and age and baseline value of the outcome variable as covariates.  Another secondary outcome will be duration of the vestibular lesion and will be analyzed using analysis of covariance with treatment group as the factor of interest, site as a stratification factor, and age as a covariate.  Correlations between DVA performance and self reported measures of dizziness symptoms (at baseline, at final, and change scores) will be determined.  Compliance with therapy will be described by treatment group.  Adverse events will be tabulated by treatment group and if warranted, the treatment groups will be compared regarding the occurrence of at least one event using Fisher's exact test.  If a subject is missing a response, missing data will be imputed using a multiple imputation algorithm.  This approach is likely to be superior to other strategies such as carrying forward the last observation which can lead to unrealistic imputed values.  The use of multiple imputation avoids the issue of artificially increasing power through data imputation associated with single-imputation methods by accounting for uncertainty associated with the imputation.  \tWe will investigate the interaction between treatment group and important baseline variables such as age, gender, and baseline DHI score by including the appropriate interaction term in the analysis of covariance model and testing for its significance.  The observation of clinically important subgroup differences in mean treatment response (e.g., men vs. women) will serve as hypothesis generation for possible future studies designed to specifically address the issue of differential therapeutic response.

We have already have used the EHR to computer phenotype ALS patients, and can use this to accelerate recruitment.	39	Patient characteristics: Clinical trials of experimental interventions in ALS use narrow inclusion criteria which exclude most ALS patients by limiting studies to patients with symptom onset within 2 years, and FVC >75% predicted.  This excludes more than half of patients who will have FVC < 75% predicted at diagnosis(25).  In focus groups, patients and their family members made it clear they find this approach makes them feel left out of studies of new or promising therapies. They suggested a more reasonable approach for inclusion would be by baseline functional status. Therefore, our inclusion criteria will be:  a) A clinical diagnosis by a study investigator of ALS; and b) ALSFRS-R ? 20 (moderately affected); and our exclusion criteria will be: a) Any medication contra-indications for the particular drugs being studied; b) inability to provide informed consent; and c) current pregnancy or lactation.	\N	Functional status is the primary outcome.  The ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) was designed to assess the ability of ALS patients to perform activities of daily living and to detect functional changes during clinical trials(52). Precedent for using this scale in clinical trials stems from the only positive treatment trial of riluzole in ALS, which showed slower decline in treated patients relative to placebo(53, 54).  The ALSFRS-R, a revised version of the ALSFRS, is a quickly administered, by research personnel or study staff (five minutes), ordinal rating scale that assesses capability and independence in 12 functional activities. These include six bulbar-respiratory functions, three upper extremity functions (writing, cutting food, and dressing), and three gross motor functions (walking, climbing, and turning in bed). Each activity is recorded to the closest approximation from a list of five choices, scored 0-4, with the total score ranging from 48 (normal function) to 0 (no function).  The ALSFRS-R has been used extensively in previous clinical trials and validity has been established by correlating ALSFRS-R scores with quantitative strength testing and changes in strength over time (55-63).    For this project we further revised the ALSFRS-R and created the ALSFRS-DEMAND. We modified the ALSFRS-R so that it would be patient user friendly and so patients could fill it out themselves. The ALSFRS- R was sent to approximately 20 ALS patients throughout the GPC region and their caregivers. They were asked if the scale was difficult to understand; if there were items they felt should be dropped from the ALSFRS-R; or if new items should be included. We held two focus group conference calls where the patients discussed and commented on the scale. Patient focus group recommendations included a need for clarification in meanings of some of the words in the ALSFRS-R, but overall the impression was that this instrument reflected the types of functional limitations they experienced on a daily basis. However, there also were several items patients believed should be added to the ALSFRS-R: a question about pain; a question about emotional liability; and a general non-denominational question about faith. These were added and our new ALSFRS-DEMAND survey is designed to be completed by patients between clinic visits and can be completed via the EHR patient portal or an individualized email link to a REDCap database.    Currently riluzole is the only approved medication for patients with ALS, which extends life by only 2-3 months. If any of the drug combinations proposed here proves effective in ALS, this will have a dramatic and immediate impact on patients, their family members, and communities.  All of the proposed drug combinations are readily accessible, registered FDA medications used for other indications, and should be available in generic formulations by the end of the study.  It would be expected most ALS patients interested could obtain access to the proposed treatments, and so benefit. In addition, if the study design innovations proposed here prove feasible this also may transform the way we approach therapies in ALS.	The 25 sites included here serve > 4,700 ALS patients.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Not provided	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	This is an open-label 3 arm design of nmax =300 patients using a Bayesian Adaptive Design for randomization.	\N	\N	659	\N	\N	180	\N	\N	We can vastly improve the efficiency of our study by using an adaptive Bayesian study design, informative priors and interval analyses to adapt randomization during the study to favor drug combinations which interval analyses suggest are beneficial. Informative priors can be drawn from The Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials data base (PRO-ACT), the largest database ever created of clinical data on ALS patients.  PRO-ACT contains over 8500 fully de-identified clinical patient records, and more than 8 million longitudinally collected data points. Patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms (groups) with a maximum number of patient's nmax= 300 (see Protocol Synopsis for specific power calculations and modeling). The primary endpoint used to drive adaptive randomization and stopping criteria is: the average disease progression (monthly measures of ALSFRS-R) from enrollment to 52 weeks. A longitudinal model using early estimates from 26 weeks will allow early adaptive randomization to promote a smaller, faster, but more powerful trial.  Interim analysis will occur after 100 patients have 52 week data and every 8 weeks thereafter.  These data will inform an updated adaptive randomization schedule. We will 'stop for success' if the probability a treatment is best is > .965. For interim analyses, all data are used on all enrolled patients with at least 26 weeks of data. For the final analysis: (1) a treatment is best if pr(it is best) > .95 or (2) a treatment is loser if pr(it is best) < .01. It was deemed the most likely effect size will be a disease progression of 1 point/month for usual care, but only 0.75 point/month for the best drug combination (an effect size greater than current SOC)(8) . For example, in the 'One Best' case, the study design has 94% power to find the best treatment with an estimated 238 subjects, trial duration of 135 weeks, and 47% of the subjects in the winning group. Type I error rate is 5%. A pre-specified subgroup analysis, suggested by our patient group, will use a Bayesian ANOVA to estimate the interaction of gender and site of onset with drug.	\N	\N	\N	\N	13	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	11	There is no significant financial interest or potential conflict that might be related to the proposal.	\N	\N	\N	t	Recruitment plan: Subjects will be recruited through a number of means: using EMR computable phenotypes to create a list of possible candidates at each site; one-on-one recruitment during individual clinic visits; using patient advocacy group (MDA, ALSA) newsletters, or clinic lists; and using the CReATE Connect ALS patient registry. The study will be listed on Clinicaltrials.gov. The 25 sites included her serve > 4,700 ALS patients.	This study aims to determine which of three drug treatment regimens (ranolazine versus mexiletine versus placebo, � riluzole and Radicava (edaravone) as standard of care has the greatest effect on slowing disease progression in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, the study aims to determine the tolerability of the drug therapies in this ALS population, their effect on respiratory function in ALS, and rates of decline using a patient-derived functional rating scale. The Investigator's hypothesis is that one of the two cardiac drugs repurposed for treating functional decline in ALS targeting sodium channels may be more effective than the current standard of care (SOC) in slowing progression of ALS, and will have a direct and immediate impact on patient care.   Aim 1: To support the clinical trial design the Investigator will leverage existing initiatives to streamline patient engagement, regulatory oversight, recruitment, outcomes data collection, and results dissemination across 3 ALS research networks and 39 sites (20 CTSAs).  Aim 2: To determine if two repurposed drugs with similar neuronal mechanisms of action (preventing nerve hyperexcitability) will slow disease progression or improve symptoms compared to placebo (standard of care) using a novel Bayesian Adaptive Design.	\N	\N	\N	Each arm of the study will consist of standard of care (SOC) as detailed in the AAN Guidelines (access to riluzole, PEG for nutrition, and NIV as indicated) plus one of three drug combinations:(10)    1) tamoxifen (20 mg: 2 times/day) and memantine (20 mg: 2 times/day);    2) tamoxifen (20 mg: 2 times/day) and mexiletine (200 mg: 3 times/day); and    3) tamoxifen (20 mg: 2 times/day) and ranolazine (500 mg: 2 times/day).

The goals of this application are 1) to create a model for leveraging existing national research initiatives and new translational science tools to build the infrastructure to run multi-site studies in rare diseases; and 2) for proof of concept, to use this CTSA-based national research infrastructure to test the hypothesis that drug combination therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) will be more effective than standard of care alone. ALS is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disease which is uniformly fatal.  Traditional approaches to developing therapies have failed in ALS, yielding only a single FDA approved therapy with a modest benefit on survival.  Thus, there is a pressing need for new therapeutic approaches in ALS. One such approach used to treat cancer and HIV has been drug combinations targeting different pathological pathways.  We convened an ALS patient and caregiver focus group who expressed overwhelming interest in using a drug 'cocktail' approach to ALS therapy. Patients also frequently state they feel left out or abandoned once their disease progresses beyond the earliest stages, the most common focus of most ALS clinical trials. Therefore, we designed a patient-driven clinical trial to assess which of three drug cocktails targeting different pathological pathways are the most effective in slowing disease progression in ALS: the ALS Patient-Driven Electronic-based Multidrug Adaptive Network Design clinical trial (ALS PATIENTs DEMAND). For ALS PATIENTs DEMAND we will leverage existing major initiatives to simplify the regulatory process, to connect electronic health records (EHRs) of large academic ALS centers, and to roll out common data elements through the EHR and via CTSA funded REDCap databases to build a large national ALS clinical trial network-providing the bandwidth to study large numbers of ALS patients, and importantly, to broaden study inclusion criteria to include ALS patients often excluded from traditional clinical trials.    Aim 1: To leverage existing research initiatives and introduce new innovations to streamline regulatory oversight, ensure meaningful patient-engagement, enhance recruitment, decrease the burden of outcome collection, and hasten results dissemination using 3 CTSA Coordinating Centers and 25 sites (20 CTSAs).  Specifically:    a.         We will compare the regulatory efficiencies across 3 different networks: two IRB reliance models (Greater Plains Collaborative: a PCORNet CDRN; and the University of California Regulatory System); and one central IRB (the ALS Rare Disease Clinical Research Network).  We will compare the time to regulatory approval, time from regulatory approval to first patient enrollment, and rates of accrual.    b.         We will create a patient engagement plan which incorporates the patient voice into all aspects of the clinical trial: protocol development, recruitment, retention, study conduct, and dissemination of results.    c.         We will use EHR-defined computable phenotypes for patient screening, and compare this approach to traditional recruitment strategies in the clinic or via patient advocacy groups.    d.         We will leverage the availability of EPIC downloadable ALS clinic templates for the primary set of outcomes to compare outcomes collected by this EHR-i2b2 interface with those collected by using REDCap database links within the local clinic work-flow. We also will explore whether this approach reduces the burden on patients, caregivers, and health care providers.    e.         We will implement a patient visit and adverse event monitoring system via a two way web-based video system already in production to reduce the burden of participation and ensure retention.    Aim 2: To determine which of three drug regimens added to standard of care has the greatest efficacy for slowing ALS disease progression.  For this aim we will conduct a prospective 12 month three-arm Bayesian response adaptive randomization clinical trial. Drug combinations will repurpose FDA approved drugs for other indications which act on potential ALS pathological pathways (neuroinflammation, motor neuron hyperexcitability, and glutamate excitotoxicity). Informative priors and stopping criteria will be derived from the PROACT data base of 8500 patients.  The diverse ALS population in our national ALS network (over 4700 patients) and the informative priors derived from PROACT will allow us to broaden our inclusion criteria to include patients often excluded from current clinical trials.    Our proposed collaboration among CTSA coordinating centers to create a model for assembling study-specific infrastructure for rare diseases will not only serve as a blueprint for future clinical trials in ALS, but also will inform any multi-center clinical trials seeking to more efficiently maximize network-level collaboration to study any disease.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	300	\N	\N

We propose a prospective cohort to test two hypotheses 1): progressive end organ disease is first detected in the kidneys and ultimately affects the cardiopulmonary system; and hypothesis 2): the progression of multi-organ system vasculopathy is attenuated by FDA approved disease modifying therapy  (hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, or both) in children, adolescents and adults.

This application interfaces with the 23andMe application program interface (API) to directly transfer a user's data to our secure servers. A series of computations are then performed on our servers and the user's estimated genetic risk is returned to them via graphical interface on the smartphone app. The genetic risk score is calculated using a weighted allele-counting approach, similar to that performed in prior studies (Mega et al. Lancet 2015). Markers and weights were selected based on results from the most current coronary artery disease GWAS meta-analysis, which identified 57 markers associated with coronary artery disease at the genome-wide level. Because all of these markers are not typically present on a genotyping array, imputation of these missing markers is performed. Haplotypes are first estimated by pre-phasing a user's genetic data against the 1000 Genomes reference panel using SHAPEIT then imputed genotypes including a 5 Mb region around each marker are calculated using IMPUTE2. The estimated contribution to disease risk from an imputed marker is calculated by treating the genotype probabilities as dosages. The resulting GRS is then compared to a population reference panel, and the resulting percentile rank of genetic risk relative to this population is returned to the user on the app. A pre and 6 months post score survey is administered via the smartphone application to determine whether therapeutic or preventative behaviors are influenced by the genetic risk score.	\N	69	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	1	\N	The primary aim of the study is to determine the influence of coronary artery disease genetic risk score information on statin use.

Objectives:    To assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of    RUC-4 plus aspirin in STEMI patients in the pre-hospital setting at 3 different RUC-4    fixed doses.    CONFIDENTIAL 84    Vol 1. 000087    Dosing:    All patients will receive aspirin as per EMS protocol. 4 arms. Arm 1: Aspirin + Single    dose saline placebo SC; Arm 2: Aspirin + Single dose RUC-4 SC based on the effective    biologic dose for a person weighing 110 kg. Arm 3. Aspirin + Single dose RUC-4 SC    based on the effective biologic dose for a person weighing 100 kg. Arm 4. Aspirin +    Single dose RUC-4 SC based on the effective biologic dose for a person weighing 90    kg. Dosing rationale: The maximum dose that will be assessed in the Phase 1 study is a    fixed dose calculated based on the effective dose for a person weighing 110 kg. As a    result, this is the highest dose that will be tested in the Phase 2 study. The two lower    doses will be tested to assess whether they are less effective or safer than the highest    dose, as might be expected.    Endpoints:    Primary: Pre-percutaneous coronary artery intervention (pre-PCI; pre-procedural)    TI    Rationale: We have selected pre-procedural TIMI 3 blood flow and TIMI perfusion    grade 3 in the target vessel as the primary endpoint since this combination has been    shown to correlate well with medical outcomes in STEMI treated with thrombolytic    therapy and since in terms of biologic plausibility it is most closely associated with the    expected benefits of early treatment with a powerful antiplatelet agent. This is    demonstrated in the meta-analysis of abciximab by Xu et al., where 'early' treatment    with abciximab was associated with a 17.7% rate of pre-procedural TIMI 3 flow    compared to 11.0% in the group receiving late abciximab (RR 2.58, 95%, CI 1.46, 3.14;    p=0.0001). Pre-procedural blood flow measured by the corrected TIMI frame count,    which provides a more precise measure of blood flow, has been variably shown to    correlate with a wide range of beneficial outcomes in STEMI patients undergoing PCI,    with the correlation being most impressive in high risk patients (anterior MI, TIMI risk    score ?3 or 4). These include improved early and late mortality, early ST-segment    resolution, better preserved ejection fraction, reduced clinical congestive heart failure,    improved myocardial blush grade, and less new onset sustained hypotension and need    for intubation. TIMI blood flow grade, corrected TIMI frame counts, and TIMI perfusion    blush grade will be performed in a core laboratory by expert analysts based on the preprocedure    angiograms.    MI 3 blood flow and TIMI perfusion grade 3 in the target vessel.    Secondary:    1. Pre-procedural TIMI 2+3 flow (since some studies have combined these for better    discrimination).,    2. TIMI frame count.    3. Pre-procedural thrombus burden.    4. Intra-procedural complications (including no reflow and distal embolization),    5. Post-procedural TIMI 3 blood flow.    6. ST segment resolution within 60 ? 30 minutes of PCI, categorized as complete    (?70%), partial (<70 to 50%), or none (<50%).    7. Infarct size measured by the area under the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) enzyme    curve from samples drawn immediately following the PCI procedure and then at 6,    12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours following PCI.    8. All-cause mortality at 90 days.    9. Complications of STEMI (ventricular fibrillation, intubation, cardiogenic shock).    10. Left ventricle ejection fraction during hospitalization.    11. Admission for congestive heart failure within 90 days.    12. Patient Reported Outcomes based on time to relief of chest pain, the the Seattle    Angina Questionnaire, the Duke Activity Status Index, and the Minnesota Living    with Heart Failure Questionnaire.    Rationale:    Some studies have combined TIMI 2 and TIMI 3 flow for comparison to TIMI 0 and    TIMI 1 flow. Resolution of ST segment elevation is also a strong correlate of clinical    outcome and was also improved by abciximab in the meta-analysis by Xu et al. (43.0 vs    35.5%; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12, 1.53; p=0.0007). We make this a secondary endpoint    because it depends both on the RUC-4 effect and the skill of the PCI team. The    endpoints in FINESSE trial, which include all-cause mortality, ventricular fibrillation,    cardiogenic shock, and 90-day risk of readmission for CHF will be additional secondary    end points.    Eligibility:    Patients of any age, either sex, weight between 55 and 110 kg, chest pain of 30 minutes    or more duration, ST segment elevation in precordial leads indicating anterior location    by the criteria used in the IMMEDIATE trial, TIMI risk score >3 time from onset of    symptoms <4 hours, planned primary PCI to begin in 1 hour or more.

This is a Phase 2, emergency medicine randomized control trial which aims to assess the safety, efficacy, and PK/PD of a novel compound (RUC-4) in the treatment for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). RUC-4 is a small molecule glycoprotein αIIbβ3 receptor antagonist intended for pre-hospital subcutaneous administration to patients with STEMIs. The hypothesis is that very early, pre-hospital treatment of STEMI with RUC-4 will increase the percentage of patients with improved coronary blood flow at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and thereby improve post-STEMI clinical outcome. The study is proposed to recruit approximately 300 subjects across 20 CTSA sites.   Timeline: The Phase 2 trial is planned to begin Q3/Q4 2018.   Funding:  This study is expected to be funded through private funding. A company, CeleCor Therapeutics, Inc.   (https://www.celecor.com/) has been formed and it has licensed RUC-4 from Rockefeller. The company has also signed an agreement with investors who have committed $6 million now and another $19 million for Phase 2 if Phase 1 is completed successfully.   Background and current NIH involvement: A Phase 1 study for RUC-4 is planned in Q1 2018 with a mix of federal and private funding. Dr Mike Solomon at NIH is the PI for the Phase 1 study and has a long-standing collaboration with the investigator, Dr Coller. The investigator has secured funding from NCATS via BrIDGs to fund the GMP lot synthesis and formulation of the drug product for the IND-enabling toxicology studies and the Phase 1 study.  NHLBI via SMARTT is funding the regulatory support expertise for preparing the Investigator Brochure and for preparing the IND.  The remaining funding comes from the Robertson Foundation.   The investigator requested a comprehensive consultation to assist with the following:   Endpoint selection   Power analysis   Recruitment plan   Feasibility Analysis   An initial consultation was conducted which consisted of a Kick-Off meeting and three Topic Specific Discussions on 1) Endpoint Selection and Statistical Analysis 2) Recruitment Plan, Feasibility analysis and IRB and 3) Patient Reported Outcomes.	\N	\N	\N	STEMI is a life-threatening disorder that is associated with significant mortality, and both short term and long term morbidity, most notably congestive heart failure. There are compelling data that early treatment (that is, within the first 2 hours after symptom onset) with fibrinolytic agents, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or ?IIb?3 antagonists can result in reperfusion and improved outcomes, including reduce mortality. Despite this information, many patients do not receive treatment within the first two hours for a variety of reasons, including delays in transport to a PCI center and delays even after reaching a PCI center.     To address the need for early therapy, we have developed a novel pure antagonist of aIIb?3, RUC-4, specially designed to facilitate rapid treatment of STEMI at the first point of medical contact, whether that is an Emergency Medical Service (EMS) ambulance, the emergency room (ER) of a 'spoke' hospital, or the ER of PCI-capable hospital. Data support the benefit of treating with one of the current aIIb?3 antagonists, abciximab, at each of these sites compared to cath laboratory treatment. RUC-4 is unique among small molecule aIIb?3 antagonists in not inducing the receptor to undergo the major conformational change that may contribute to the development of thrombocytopenia and may also limit efficacy by inducing the high affinity ligand binding state. It is also unique in its design for subcutaneous (SC) administration and its high solubility, making it possible to be conveniently administered by autoinjector. This contrasts with the need for intravenous administration as a bolus and continuous infusion via a pump for the other agents.     We conducted the RUC-4 Pre-IND meeting with the FDA on July 18, 2016 and the FDA approved with minor amendments to the Phase 1 studies (attached), which are designed to assess the tolerability of RUC-4 in patients with stable coronary disease who are taking aspirin and to identify a fixed dose of RUC-4 that can achieve the biologic endpoint goal of inhibiting platelet aggregation induced by 5 mM ADP by ?80% within 15 minutes of administration.     The goals of the two Phase 2 studies, as currently conceived are to: 1. assess whether the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of RUC-4 are different in patients with STEMI than in patients with stable coronary artery disease, and 2. Identify a dose of RUC-4 that is worthy of testing in a Phase 3 study based on its safety (bleeding being the major expected toxicity based on data from existing aIIb?3 antagonists) and efficacy. Currently, we propose to assess the latter by measuring the known clinical complications of STEMI as well as the surrogate indicators of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) blood flow and myocardial perfusion in the target vessel prior to PCI, ST segment resolution, and infarct size. While the original plan was to perform this study exclusively with EMS personnel in ambulances, based on the data showing similar benefits from administering aIIb?3 antagonist in in ERs of both 'spoke' and PCI-capable hospitals (see attached slide deck) we now plan to expand the study to all of these first medical contact sites. The draft design of the Phase 2 study is attached, along with a brief description of the proposed Phase 3 study. I will also be pleased to supply the Pre-IND FDA Meeting Document and the FDA Minutes of that meeting.    For the Phase 2 study we request assistance with the power calculations to judge the number of individuals we will need to study in both phases of the study. We would also appreciate assistance in the design of the informed consent process, developing the detailed methodology for assessing each endpoint, and the statistical analysis plan. We would also benefit greatly from an assessment of recruitment feasibility. Finally, we would like assistance in these same areas for the design of the Phase 3 study.     We would of course be delighted to propose the Phase 2 (and later Phase 3) study to the CTSA trial network. The new SIREN consortium may help complement the CTSA trial network. I plan to contact the successful coordinating center as soon as the award is made.	1	28	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	49	20	\N	1	\N	See Objective/Hypothesis.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	300	\N	\N

Subjects  will continue the same dose of their concomitant background MTX. If the subject's CDAI score is greater  than 10 at 18 weeks, a good treatment response has not been achieved116, then treatment will be  switched to the other TNFi of interest for this trial. Subjects who initially started etanercept will be  switched to adalimumab 40 mg SQ every other week. Subjects who initially started adalimumab will be  switched to entanercept 50 mg SQ weekly. Subjects will remain on this new medication until the end of  the study at 24 weeks.  Subjects assigned to the triple therapy arm will begin SSZ 500 mg bid and HCQ 200 mg twice daily, not to  exceed 6.5mg/kg HCQ (in addition to concomitant MTX). At 6 weeks, SSZ will be increased to 1 g bid for  all subjects. If the subject's CDAI score is greater than 10 at 18 weeks, a good treatment response116 has  not been achieved, and MTX will be switched to leflunomide 20 mg daily. The participant will remain on  leflunomide (and concomitant SSZ + HCQ) for the remaining six weeks of the study.	This will be a multicenter study with approximately 40 study sites. 400 RA patients will be recruited over  a planned recruitment period of 24 month, 200 will be randomized.

The two arms of the trial both use standard of care treatments, so serious  unanticipated adverse events are unlikely. Reports of adverse events by randomized treatment  assignment and actual treatment will be generated for the DSMB at regular intervals of approximately 6  months. We will also present frequency analyses for withdrawals and compliance with protocol.	Approximately forty clinical sites will participate in enrolling subjects for the TARGET study. The study  sites play an essential role in answering the questions posed by this study. Each site will be responsible  for enrolling participants, carrying out the study protocol, recording and transmitting study information,  satisfying regulatory requirements, and providing clinical oversight. The DCC and Administrative Core  will support Sites in these efforts, from training through implementation. As well, the Imaging Core will  support the FDG PET/CT acquisition.  Site Requirements for Eligibility include:  • Prior experience with clinical trials  • At least 150 active RA patients  • Easy access to FDG-PET CT imaging acquisition facility  • Easy access to standard clinical laboratory assessments  • Joint count assessor  T	\N	\N	\N	\N	60 months	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3. STUDY DESIGN  3.1 Overview  This is a multi-center, phase IV, 24-week, two arm randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects of  DMARD associated changes in vascular inflammation in patients with RA. The overall study design is  shown in Figure 1. Two hundred patients with RA who are inadequate responders to MTX monotherapy  (MTX-IRs, DAS28>3.2) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a TNFi or SSZ + HCQ, while  continuing background MTX, for 24 weeks. Although the joint count assessors and imaging readers will  be blinded to treatment assessment, the subjects and investigators will not be blinded.    Randomization and Blinding  Upon confirmation of subject eligibility, the Site Coordinator will determine treatment assignment  through a randomization function of the electronic data capture (EDC). Randomization will be  performed centrally by the DCC using a permuted block design. Metrologists performing joint  counts will be blinded to treatment assignment, as will the FDG-PET/CT imaging readers. Laboratory  staff who run bioassays on biospecimen samples will also be blinded to treatment assignment.  Subjects will be instructed NOT to discuss their treatment with the metrologist, and the metrologist  will not be a part of the subject's care team. The metrologist will also be instructed to remind the  subject before each joint examination that treatment should not be discussed. In addition, the  metrologist should not discuss treatment with the site PI or other study staff.	\N	\N	307	\N	\N	69	\N	\N	We plan to randomize 200 participants to achieve an effective sample size of 170 people with complete  follow-up and measurements of both the baseline and 6-month MDS TBRmax. We estimate over 90%  power to detect a difference of 0.15 in 6-month MDS meanmax TBR between the two arms, even  allowing for a 10% dropout rate. A between group difference of 0.15 also corresponds to the expected  observed effect if the between group difference were 0.17 and there was a 10% crossover rate.  Sample size and power were calculated using several alternative scenarios for dropout rates and cross  over. All cross over was assumed to be from the triple therapy arm into the TNFi arm and these  participants would be included in the main intention-to-treat analysis set under their assigned  treatment group. Drop outs consist of participants for whom imaging results were unavailable at the  baseline or 6-month timepoint. These participants would be unable to contribute to the analysis and  would directly reduce the sample size available. Previous data in the RA population found a baseline  MDS meanmax TBR of 2.51 (SD of 0.33) and a 0.46 reduction after 8 weeks of a TNFi (correlation of 0.5  between baseline and 8 weeks).  The method that we intend to use for our primary analysis is an ANCOVA model estimating the final  index vessel MDS meanmax TBR as a function of baseline index vessel MDS meanmax TBR and  treatment group. The resulting treatment group coefficient will then estimate the change in MDS  meanmax TBR associated with treatment assignment after adjusting for baseline differences.  Power for the ANCOVA analysis was calculated using the sampsi function in Stata. This function uses the  method laid out by Frison and Pocock in Statistics in Medicine in 1992. We performed the power  calculations using a correlation between the baseline and final MDS TBR meanmax of conservative  correlation estimates of 0.4 and 0.3 and have included the results in the Tables 4A and 4B below.  TABLE 4a: Power Calculation for Aim 1 for Correlation of 0.4 (ANCOVA adjusting for  baseline)  44  Dropout Rate  Between group difference 0% (N=200) 5% (N=190) 10% (N=180)  0.17 98% 97% 96%  0.16 (5% crossover into TNFi) 96% 95% 94%  0.15 (10% crossover into TNFi) 94% 93% 91%  TABLE 4b: Power Calculation for Aim 1 for Correlation of 0.3 (ANCOVA adjusting for  baseline)  Dropout Rate  Between group difference 0% (N=200) 5% (N=190) 10% (N=180)  0.17 97% 96% 95%  0.16 (5% crossover into TNFi) 95% 94% 93%  0.15 (10% crossover into TNFi) 92% 91% 89%  Power for the secondary aims  The secondary aim compares 6-month MDS meanmax TBR by LDAR achievement. The primary analysis  will use ANCOVA to adjust for baseline MDS meanmax TBR as well as other baseline characteristics  related to LDAR achievement (age, gender, disease duration, smoking status, serologic status) and  treatment assignment. Assuming 30% reaching LDAR in both groups111-113, and the parameters of MDS  meanmax TBR from Aim 1, we use a t-test of 6-month MDS meanmax TBR as a conservative power  estimate. The proposed trial will have 90% power to detect an absolute difference between those  reaching LDAR and those not of 0.18 in MDS meanmax TBR with a dropout rate of up to 10%; this would  be clinically significant based on the aforementioned statin study52  .  TABLE 5: POWER CALCULATION FOR AIM 2  Dropout Rate  Between group difference 0% (N=200) 5% (N=190) 10% (N=180)  0.18 94% 93% 92%  0.17 91% 90% 88%  45  0.16 88% 86% 84%  7.5 Analysis Sets  The primary analysis for efficacy will be defined as all randomized subjects with complete imaging  results at baseline and 6 months, according to their randomized treatment assignment. Safety analyses  will be done using all subjects entering the study, according to the treatment received. Per-protocol  analyses will also be done for participants who remained on their randomized treatment assignment for  the duration of follow-up.  7.6 Safety Analysis  All participating subjects will be included in safety analyses, regardless of their completion of the  imaging studies. The two arms of the trial both use standard of care treatments, so serious  unanticipated adverse events are unlikely. Reports of adverse events by randomized treatment  assignment and actual treatment will be generated for the DSMB at regular intervals of approximately 6  months. We will also present frequency analyses for withdrawals and compliance with protocol.  7.7 Analysis Methods  Aim 1:  The main analysis for Aim 1 will use ANCOVA to compare the 6-month arterial MDS meanmax TBR  between assigned treatment groups, adjusting for baseline values and statin initiation, with a null  hypothesis of no association between treatment assignment and 6-month MDS meanmax TBR. A pvalue  threshold of 0.05 for a two-sided test will be used to determine statistical significance. Additional  analyses will explore secondary imaging measures including meanmax overall TBR. We will also repeat  the main analysis in the subgroup per-protocol compliance. Other important subgroups will also be  analyzed within assigned treatment groups using an interaction term, including achievement of LDAR,  serologic status, known CV risk factors, and excluding statin initiators.  The primary analysis will be based on assigned treatment group, only including participants with imaging  data at baseline and 6-month follow-up. A sensitivity analysis for the impact of any missing data will also  be done using the same assigned treatment categories, but using all randomized participants with  [multiple imputations using a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique119. We anticipate few missing data  because: 1) adequate staff (2 Research Assistants) in the Administrative Core will closely monitor weekly  data entry; 2) 24-week trial allows for detection of significant differences in vascular FDG PET/CT but will  reduce drop-out that may occur in a longer trial; 3) recruitment of experienced sites with site  coordinators; 4) providing transportation reimbursement to subjects whenever necessary; and 5)  providing reminder mailing cards to sites to send to subjects. 2 secondary analyses were added based  on reviewers' comments: excluding subjects who escalated dosing; and, in an exploratory secondary  analysis, we will compare the 6-month MDS meanmax TBR between adalimumab and etanercept users.  46  Sample Size: Power to detect alternate absolute differences in  6 month MDS meanmax TBR is presented in Figure 2 for a  study with 100 participants in each arm (200 total randomized  target). Previous data in RA pts found a baseline MDS  meanmaxTBR of 2.51 (SD of 0.33) and a 0.46 reduction after 8  weeks of a TNFi62. Using a t-test to compare MDS meanmax  TBR in the two arms at 6-months generates a conservative  power estimate. With an effective sample size of 170 (200-30;  15% drop-out or cross-over), the proposed trial has a 90%  power to detect an absolute difference of 0.17 between the 2  arms. This difference corresponds to the effect observed in  the prior study by Maki-Petaja for TNFi's62. It would be a  clinically important difference, on the same order for what was observed between a low-dose statin and  a high-dose statin52, a contrast with known clinical significance53  . [Power will be sufficient for secondary  endpoints. The pre-specified secondary analysis focusing on approximately 75% of subjects remain on  the original drug dosages will include an estimated 64 subjects per arm and will have 90% power to  detect a difference of 0.19 in MDS meanmax TBR. Since these are pre-specified secondary endpoints, pvalues  will not be adjusted.]  Aim 2a:  This aim compares 6-month MDS meanmax TBR by LDAR achievement. The primary analysis will use  ANCOVA to adjust for baseline MDS meanmax TBR as well as other baseline characteristics related to  LDAR achievement (age, gender, disease duration, smoking status, serologic status) and treatment  assignment. Using a conservative estimate of 30% reaching LDAR in both groups111-113, and an effective  sample size of 170, we ran a t-test of 6-month MDS meanmax TBR as a conservative power estimate.  The proposed trial will have 90% power to detect an absolute difference between those reaching LDAR  and those not of 0.19 in MDS meanmax TBR; this difference would be clinically significant based on the  aforementioned statin study52  .  Aims 2b and 2c: These exploratory aims will examine the relationship between the Vectra-DA and  articular FDG uptake (respectively), and 6-month change in arterial MDS meanmax TBR. The analytic  strategies will be very similar to Aim 2a. Relationships between Vectra-DA disease activity categories  and articular FDG PET/CT disease activity and 6-month change in MDS meanmax TBR will be analyzed  similar to Aim 2a. The statistical power for Aims 2b and 2c will be very similar to Aim 2a. Exploratory  analyses will examine: 1) alternative thresholds for disease activity using the Vectra-DA and articular  FDG PET/CT; 2) using the Vectra-DA and articular FDG PET/CT as continuous measures; and 3) including  the Vectra-DA and articular FDG PET/CT continuous measures as covariates in the ANCOVA conducted  for Aim 2a.	\N	\N	\N	Canada	4	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	9	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	This will be a multicenter study with approximately 40 study sites. 400 RA patients will be recruited over  a planned recruitment period of 24 month, 200 will be randomized. The target population consists of  patients who are deemed methotrexate-inadequate responders (MTX-IRs, DAS28>3.2) by their treating  rheumatologist, and who have not yet stepped up to additional treatment with a biologic DMARD.  Patients will be identified for potential recruitment by methods that may include using physician  referral, pre-screening enrollment logs, IRB or Sponsor approved sources, such as newspaper/radio  advertisements and/or mailing lists. Informed consent will be obtained by the Principal Investigator, co-  25  investigator, or Study Coordinator at each site. Study procedures including screening procedures will not  begin until signed informed consent has been obtained.  .  3.5 Recruitment and Retention  3.5.1 Recruitment Plan  The target population to be recruited is men aged 45 and older or women aged 50 and older with a  clinical diagnosis of RA who are deemed methotrexate-inadequate responders (MTX-IR) by their  treating rheumatologist. Patients will be recruited from participating rheumatology and arthritis  clinics and practices at participating sites across the United States. A recommended method for  identifying and recruiting patients is described in the following sections and in more detail in the  MOOP. Sites will generate and maintain a list of patients that may become eligible for the study  based on a HIPAA-compliant review of medical records of existing RA patients. The treating  rheumatologists will alert study staff when a patient is deemed a MTX-IR, prior to a switch or  escalation of DMARDs. The Site Coordinator will speak with the patient to go over pre-screening  inclusion/exclusion criteria, explain the trial, and assess interest (Recruitment training will be  provided). The Study Brochure can be given to interested patients.  If the patient is interested in participating, a Site PI, Co-I, or Site Coordinator must obtain informed  consent prior to any screening procedures. The research protocol will be explained in detail,  including all possible risks and benefits. During the consent process, the study coordinator or  investigator probes the patient's understanding of the protocol. All participants will be told that the  study is voluntary, that they have no obligation to participate, and that they may decline or  withdraw at any time without compromising their care. Subjects will have ample opportunity to ask  questions prior to signing the consent form. Eligible subjects will be allowed as much time as  necessary to determine whether they wish to participate in the study.  Patients will be identified for potential recruitment by methods that may include using physician  referral, pre-screening enrollment logs, IRB or Sponsor approved sources, such as newspaper/radio  advertisements and/or mailing lists. Consent will be obtained at the beginning of the Screening Visit (Visit 1). Patients who meet eligibility criteria and provide informed consent will be considered enrolled and will undergo the  additional screening procedures outlined above in Table 1, including completion of questionnaires, screening laboratory tests including hepatitis B and C screens and tuberculosis screening (if none in the past six months),hemoglobin A1c test only for Type II diabetics if none from the past six months, and chest x-ray without evidence of interstitial lung disease (if none in past 12 months). Subjects found at Screening to have active hepatitis or active infection (including tuberculosis) or interstitial  lung disease will be excluded. If the additional required screening blood work was completed by the  subject within 1 week of the screening visit (see 3.4 above), these tests do not need to be repeated.  If the subject has been on stable methotrexate or prednisone for the 8 weeks preceding the  screening visit, then safety labs performed during those 8 weeks do not need to be repeated at the  screening visit. CRP testing must be complete at the date of Screening when a joint count is done  to determine the subject's eligibility for study inclusion. If these additional laboratory- and imagingbased  eligibility criteria are met and eligibility is confirmed, the FDG PET/CT scan will be scheduled.  For the FDG PET/CT, the subject will be given instructions for an overnight fast for the purposes of  the PET/CT scan. If nothing is found on the FDG PET/CT that would preclude the subject from  randomization, the subject will be randomized and a baseline visit will be conducted. The subject  will complete additional questionnaires at baseline. All subsequent study visits are performed at six  week intervals and should be conducted within 14 days prior to or after the designated date  (calculated from the subject's randomization date). Blood will be drawn at each visit for safety  monitoring; additional fasting blood specimens will be drawn at Visits 2, 3, 5 and 6 for the research  biospecimen repository. A repeat FDG PET-CT scan will be performed at 24 weeks.  3.6 Subject Retention  We aim to have a 90% retention rate in order to meet the guidelines established by the NIH. Once  enrolled, a proactive plan for retention will be implemented that includes elements such as regular  phone and mailed reminders for each study visit, parking and meal vouchers, complimentary items such  as pens and canvas totes with the study logo, birthday and holiday cards, etc. Arguably, most  importantly, we will train sites to follow major principles and commonly used strategies to maximize  retention and minimize loss to follow-up. These are outlined in detail in the MOOP and include building  subject relations and subject satisfaction, with the study coordinator taking a central role in this effort,  emphasizing the importance of congeniality, respectfulness and friendliness in interactions with  participants.    Subject Withdrawal  All subjects receive active therapy and the trial is relatively short in duration; thus, we anticipate few  withdrawals and/or cross-overs. Furthermore, the ability to titrate the regimens will limit withdrawal  and/or cross-over. As noted above, great effort will be made to retain subjects in the study.  Nonetheless, subjects have the right to refuse treatment or completely withdraw from the study at any  time for any reason. An explanation of why the subject is withdrawing from the study should be  recorded on the withdrawal eCRF. The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the  study treatment in the event of AE, protocol violations, administrative reasons, or for other reasons.  When applicable, subjects should be informed of circumstances under which their participation may be  terminated by the investigator without the subject's consent. Any administrative or other reasons for  withdrawal must be documented and explained to the subject. If the reason for removal of a subject  from the study is an adverse event, the principal specific event will be recorded on the CRF. The subject  should be followed until the AE has resolved. If it appears that a subject is lost to follow-up, the  investigator must attempt to contact the subject or a responsible relative by telephone, to determine if  any new AEs occurred, follow-up of any ongoing AE, and to establish as completely as possible the  reason for the withdrawal.    Study treatment may be discontinued for any subject who experiences any of the following:  • Extreme laboratory value (see Section 4.5.1 Abnormal Lab Values)  • Malignancy other than basal or squamous cell  • Repeated subject non-compliance or loss to follow-up.  • The subject withdraws consent  • The investigator or DSMB believes it is in the best interest of the subject  • The study is terminated  If study treatment is discontinued (e.g., for an adverse event) and there is no safety issue precluding it,  the subject will be asked to return for the follow-up FDG PET/CT scan if he/she has received at least  eight weeks of the randomized treatment prior to withdrawal.  In addition, if the subject decides to withdraw from treatment assignment before trial completion, the  subject will be asked to come in for a follow-up FDG PET/CT scan within 2 weeks of stopping their  randomized treatment assignment and before initiating any new treatment. Subjects will only be asked  to come for a follow-up FDG PET/CT if they have been on the trial assigned treatment for at least 8  weeks. If they have been on less than 8 weeks of study treatment before wanting to withdraw, they will  not undergo a second scan.  If the subject withdraws consent, all study related visits, exams, procedures and data collection are  terminated.  29  3.8 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study  This study may be suspended or prematurely terminated by the DSMB or by the NIH if there is sufficient  reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination,  will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to investigators, funding agency and regulatory  authorities. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the principal investigator will  promptly inform the IRB and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. 7.3 Study Design  TARGET is a randomized, open-label, multi-center trial. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated,  1:1, to TNFi + MTX or triple therapy. Baseline imaging will be done at the time of randomization and  subjects will be followed for 6 months, at which time the follow-up imaging will be done.	The overarching goal of this trial is to examine the effect of RA disease  modifying drugs (DMARDs) on vascular inflammation. We will accomplish  this goal by comparing two treatment regimens for RA in the setting of an  RCT in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX)  monotherapy. These are: a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) + MTX  versus triple therapy (MTX + sulfasalazine [SSZ] + hydroxychloroquine  [HCQ]). The trial design is a two-arm RCT with blinded joint assessment and  blinded FDG PET/CT readers. Subjects and rheumatologists will be  unblinded to treatment assignment but will be blinded to FDG PET/CT  results. Joint count assessors will be blinded to treatment assignment. The  trial will be conducted at multiple sites across the US, with a duration of six  months. Recruitment will be over 24 months with six more months of  follow-up.  Objectives: Primary: To compare the effects on vascular inflammation of TNFi + MTX  versus triple therapy in subjects with RA who are inadequate responders  to MTX monotherapy using FDG PET/CT as a tool for detecting vascular  (arterial) inflammation.  Secondary: To compare the effects on vascular inflammation of achieving  low disease activity or remission (LDAR) vs moderate-high disease activity  (MHDA).  Population: Subjects for this trial will be RA patients who are deemed methotrexateinadequate  responders (MTX-IRs, DAS28>3.2) by their treating  rheumatologist, and who have not yet started treatment with a biologic  DMARD and are currently not receiving any other DMARD than MTX. In  order to enrich our trial subjects for atherosclerosis, male RA patients must  be at least 45 years old, and women at least 50 years old. Additional  inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Section 3 of this document.  Phase: Phase IV  Number of Sites: This will be a multicenter study. The lead sites will be Brigham & Women's  Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center.  Participating sites will be selected based on the following criterion:  adequate number of RA patients; access to an FDG-PET scanner; availability   9  of trial staff (i.e. coordinator, nurse, trained joint count assessor  (metrologist); and experience enrolling and following subjects in previous  clinical trials.  Description of  Intervention:  Enrolled subjects will be asked to take 6 months of RA medication according  to the treatment arm to which they are randomized, which will be either be  triple therapy or a TNFi.  Subjects will be evaluated every six weeks for clinical response. For subjects  receiving a TNFi, if good treatment response (CDAI ≤10) is not achieved by  18 weeks, then treatment will be adjusted. For subjects receiving  adalimumab, this medication will be discontinued and switched to  etanercept 50 mg every week. If the subject is receiving etanercept, this  medication will be discontinued and switched to adalimumab 40 mg every  other week. Subjects will remain on this new medication until the end of the  study at 24 weeks.  Subjects assigned to the triple therapy arm will begin SSZ 500 mg twice daily  and HCQ 200 mg twice daily, not to exceed 6.5 mg/kg. At 6 weeks, the dose  of SSZ will increase from 500 mg twice daily to 1 g twice daily for all  patients. At 18 weeks, if a good treatment response (CDAI ≤ 10) has not  been achieved, MTX will be stopped and leflunomide 20 mg daily started.  The participant will remain on leflunomide (and concomitant SSZ + HCQ) for  the remaining six weeks of the study.  Study Duration: 48 months  Subject Participation  Duration:  6 months  Estimated Time to  Complete Enrollment:  24 months	\N	\N	\N	A brief description of each of the study medications (all of which, as noted above, are FDA approved) is  provided below. More detailed descriptions of each drug are provided in the following links to the FDA  approved package inserts:  1) Adalimumab: http://www.rxabbvie.com/pdf/humira.pdf  2) Etanercept: http://pi.amgen.com/united_states/enbrel/derm/enbrel_pi.pdf  3) Sulfasalazine: http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=524  4) Hydroxychloroquine:  http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/009768s041lbl.pdf  5) Leflunomide: http://products.sanofi.us/arava/arava.html  6) Methotrexate Injection:  http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/011719s117lbl.pdf  7) Methotrexate tablets: http://www.rheumatrex.info/pdf/RheumatrexPackageInsert.pdf  Etanercept. The standard dose of etanercept is 50 mg SC once weekly. The drug is provided  already diluted to the appropriate concentration in pre-filled syringes. It is typically injected into the  abdomen or thigh. The medication must be refrigerated.  Adalimumab. The standard initial dose of adalimumab is 40 mg SC once every other week. Like  etanercept, it is provided already diluted to the appropriate concentration in pre-filled syringes. It is  also injected into the abdomen or thigh and must be refrigerated.  30  Sulfasalazine. SSZ is formulated as tablets for oral use. Maximum dosing is usually 1500 mg bid.  Patients with Sulfa allergies or G6PD deficiency should not be prescribed this medication and are  excluded from the study.  Hydroxychloroquine. The approved dose of HCQ is either 200 mg once daily or twice daily. HCQ  dose shall not exceed 6.5 mg/kg to conform to current guidelines for retinal safety. The most recent  recommendations from the American Academy of Ophthalmology advise a baseline screening  examination within the first twelve months of treatment115  .  Leflunomide. Leflunomide is approved at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg once daily. We will use 20 mg  daily as it is the most common effective dose.    Subjects randomized to the TNFi treatment arm will (based on randomization) receive either etanercept  50 mg SC weekly or adalimumab 40 mg SQ every other week (in addition to concomitant MTX). Subjects  will continue the same dose of their concomitant background MTX. If the subject's CDAI score is greater  than 10 at 18 weeks, a good treatment response has not been achieved116, then treatment will be  switched to the other TNFi of interest for this trial. Subjects who initially started etanercept will be  switched to adalimumab 40 mg SQ every other week. Subjects who initially started adalimumab will be  switched to entanercept 50 mg SQ weekly. Subjects will remain on this new medication until the end of  the study at 24 weeks.  Subjects assigned to the triple therapy arm will begin SSZ 500 mg bid and HCQ 200 mg twice daily, not to  exceed 6.5mg/kg HCQ (in addition to concomitant MTX). At 6 weeks, SSZ will be increased to 1 g bid for  all subjects. If the subject's CDAI score is greater than 10 at 18 weeks, a good treatment response116 has  not been achieved, and MTX will be switched to leflunomide 20 mg daily. The participant will remain on  leflunomide (and concomitant SSZ + HCQ) for the remaining six weeks of the study.  4.4 Concomitant Medications  4.4.1 Corticosteriods  Patients who are not receiving corticosteroids and those receiving low dose steroids (≤ 10 mg/day of  prednisone or equivalent) will be considered eligible for the study provided other entry criteria are  met. Excessive dosages of steroids may suppress vascular FDG uptake independently of the  randomized treatment. Prednisone (or equivalent) doses should not be altered by more than ±3.0  mg during the six months of the study. Two intra-articular injections of <40 mg triamcinolone (or  equivalent) will be allowed during the study, but cannot be within one month of the second FDG  PET/CT at the 24 week visit. No oral corticosteroid "bursts" will be allowed unless there is reason  that an intra-articular injection is impossible. If a burst is required, it can be no more than 10mg per  day (prednisone equivalent) at maximum and no longer than 14 days in duration before returning to   +/- 3 mg of the original dose (or no use). Corticosteroid bursts cannot occur within one month of  either of the FDG PET/CT scans.  4.4.2 Statins & PCSK9 Inhibitors  Statins and PCSK9 inhibitors have been shown to reduce arterial FDG uptake52. Therefore, patients  who have ever been treated with statins or PCSK9 inhibitors in the past 12 months or are currently  on a statin or a PCSK9 inhibitor are not eligible for the study. Patients likely to need a statin or  PCSK9 inhibitor (e.g., diabetics and those with prior clinical CV events) are excluded from  participation. Initiation of statins or PCSK9 inhibitors should be avoided if at all possible during the  six month study period. If this is not deemed safe by the study site investigator and one of the two  cardiologists working on the trial (Drs.Tawakol and Ridker), then the subject will be asked to come in  for a follow-up FDG PET/CT before a statin or PCSK9 inhibitor is initiated. Subjects must have been  on study treatment for at least 8 weeks in order for the FDG PET/CT to take place. If the subject has  been on study treatment for less than 8 weeks, the subject will be dropped from the trial without  completion of the follow-up PET scan. If a subject initiates a statin or PCSK9 inhibitor before a  follow-up FDG PET/CT takes place, the subject will be dropped from the trial without follow-up  imaging. This information will be included in the primary trial analysis	1	224	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	13	40	\N	2	\N	7. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  7.1 Primary and Secondary Objectives  The primary objective is to compare the effects on vascular inflammation of TNFi + MTX versus triple  therapy in subjects with RA who are inadequate responders to MTX monotherapy using FDG-PET/CT as a  tool for detecting vascular (arterial) inflammation.  The secondary objective is to compare the effects on vascular inflammation of achieving low disease  activity or remission (LDAR) versus moderate-high disease activity (MHDA).  7.2 Study Hypothesis  The primary aim of the Treatments Against RA and Effect on FDG PET/CT (TARGET) trial is to test  whether treatment with a TNF inhibitor (TNFi) in addition to methotrexate (MTX) among RA subjects  who are inadequate responders to MTX monotherapy reduces cardiovascular inflammation compared  to triple therapy (MTX+SSZ+HCQ) as measured by the mean of the maximum target-to-background ratio  (TBR) of FDG uptake at the 6 month follow-up for the most diseased segment (MDS) identified at  baseline. .  The primary hypothesis is that TNFi +MTX will reduce vascular inflammation to a greater extent than  triple therapy when measured at 6 months.  Additional planned analyses in the second aim test whether the follow-up value in cardiovascular  inflammation is correlated with measures of disease progression. The markers of disease progression  include: 1) disease activity as measured by the DAS28-CRP score, with achievement of low disease  activity or remission considered to be a DAS28-CRP score of less than 3.2 at the 6-month follow-up (all  participants enter the trial with a DAS28 above 3.2); 2) a commercially available MBDA (Vectra-DA)  which will be measured at baseline and 6 months; and 3) joint inflammation defined as the average  standardized uptake value (by FDG PET/CT) in the same joints used in the calculation of the DAS-28, and  measured at baseline and 6 months using the images collected for the primary endpoint as described in  the Imaging Section.  The secondary hypotheses are as follows:   We hypothesize that subjects in DAS-28 defined LDAR at 6 months will have less vascular  inflammation than those with persistent MHDA.   We hypothesize that subjects in Vectra DA-defined LDAR at 6 months will have less vascular  inflammation than those with persistent MHDA.   43   We hypothesize that subjects in articular FDG defined LDAR at 6 months will have less  vascular inflammation than those with persistent MHDA. We will also compare the correlations  of the articular FDG uptake and DAS-28 with vascular inflammation to determine if they are  independent	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	400	\N	\N

Intervention purpose: To test whether emollient therapy from birth can prevent the development of atopic dermatitis.    Study phase: N/A    Assigning intervention: random assignment in a parallel, pragmatic trial: group 1 (daily emollient), group 2 (no emollient)    Number of arms: 2    Allocation to arm: Dyads will be automatically randomized after the parent has completed enrollment using a computer-generated randomization schedule. Randomization will be stratified by clinic and parent-reported history of atopic disease in the infant's first-degree relatives at the time of randomization to ensure balance within sites and groups.	\N	\N	405	\N	\N	54	\N	\N	For descriptive statistics, we will present categorical variables as count and percentages and continuous variables as mean with standard deviations. We will treat ordinal variables as categorical in this context. For inferential tests, we present the point estimate and confidence interval. Models should include stratification variables, i.e. family history of atopy and primary clinic where randomized. In the primary analysis, use an overall type I error rate of 0.05 with critical values determined using an O'Brien-Fleming spending function. Secondary outcomes will be considered significant at α=0.05 and exploratory analyses at α=0.1. All tests will be two-tailed.    For the primary analysis, contrast the risk of diagnosed atopic dermatitis (AD) by two years of age for the intervention versus control groups under an intention-to-treat (ITT) assumption, analyzing all subjects according to the group to which they were allocated regardless of adherence or group cross-over, and imputing missing outcome values using multiple imputation methods.     The model for the binary outcome of AD by 24 months of age will include a variable for study arm (intervention=1, control=0) to be evaluated with a Wald test of the coefficient at the 0.047 level of significance, which gives an overall α=0.05 subsequent to analysis. Because randomization will have been stratified by clinic and family history of atopy in a first-degree relative (yes/no), include these covariates as fixed effects.17, 18 (While clinics are often modeled as random effects, this approach is problematic in the context of multiple imputation and so fixed effects are preferred.) Estimate the relative risk as the exponentiated coefficient of the study arm variable and report this estimate with its 95% confidence interval. Also report adjusted group prevalence using average conditional predicted risk, and calculate standard errors (SE) and 95% confidence intervals using the delta method, which is a standard method to compute SE of nonlinear transformations and can be executed using Stata's -margins- command, for example.	\N	\N	\N	\N	17	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	4	\N	t	\N	\N	f	\N	This is a pragmatic, multi-site, randomized community-based trial in which dyads of a parent or legal guardian and an infant age 0 to 2 months are enrolled.

The primary outcome measure will be fever at 24 h following initiation of study drug infusion. Secondary outcomes will be the change in levels of inflammatory parameters and change in coronary artery Z score by echocardiogram. PROs will be analyzed and incorporated into the final assessment.    Main components of the intervention:    IVIG-resistant KD patients (defined as T? 38.0�C rectally or orally between 36 hours and 7 days after end of IVIG infusion without another likely cause) will be randomized to receive either infliximab (10 mg/kg) or second IVIG infusion (2g/kg). The primary outcome measure will be fever 24 hours after the initiation of their study drug infusion. Subjects with persistent fever at 24 hours will cross-over to the other study treatment. Patients who are afebrile 24 hours following initiation of study drug administration will be discharged on low dose aspirin. Patients will return for an echocardiogram and laboratory assessment at 2 weeks following discharge.     Study Design and Randomization:  This is a 3-year (2.75-year of enrollment), Phase III, two-arm, randomized, multi-center, superiority treatment study to compare infliximab to a second intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion for treatment of persistent or recrudescent fever in children with KD who fail to become afebrile after the first IVIG infusion. The trial will be open label but the outcome adjudication will be blinded. Once eligibility and consent are confirmed, subjects will be assigned to a treatment arm by the pharmacy according to a pre-specified randomization scheme stratified by center and then sex (male/female) and age (dichotomous variable >1 year or ? 1 year) via a randomly permuted block design of block sizes of 2 and 4. The randomization sequence will be generated by the Biostatistics team using the software R (version 3.1.1).  The electronic randomization list will be securely transmitted to the pharmacy team at each site, who will randomize subjects based on this list. It would not be possible to blind the treatment as the infusion times and nursing protocols are very different for the two treatments. Infliximab is given over two hours and IVIG is given over 8-12 hours with specific nursing monitoring for infusion reactions and incremental increases in the infusion rate. To ensure appropriate representation of subjects from all study sites, we may consider restricting enrollment from any site that exceeds 30% of the total study enrollment.  This approach will be discussed and evaluated on the investigator calls with all sites.        Outcome Measures and Schedule of Measurements:    1) Fever: Cessation of fever (<38�C rectally or orally) within 24h of initiation of study drug infusion will be the primary outcome measure. This will be assessed by measurements of temperature taken from enrollment to 24 hours of study drug infusion.     2) Resolution of Inflammation: This will be measured by the change in white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration between baseline, 24 hours and 2 weeks following study treatment.    3) Coronary artery changes: This will compare the echocardiographic Z scores of the left anterior descending coronary artery and right coronary artery at baseline and 2 weeks following study treatment .	\N	\N	629	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Since this is a superiority study design, an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be used to analyze the outcome data regarding patient outcomes. Results will be reported as point estimates (odds ratios or mean differences across groups, as appropriate) and interval estimates (95% confidence intervals).  All tests of significance for the secondary outcomes will be 2-sided and Hochberg adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons.  A p-value ? 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  Statistical analysis will be conducted using the statistical software R 3.1.1. (www.rproject.org).  Demographic and baseline characteristics will be compared between the study arms using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and a two-sample t-test for continuous variables.  Appropriate non-parametric alternatives will be considered, if parametric assumptions fail.     Analysis of Primary Outcome (Specific Aim 1): The primary outcome (Specific Aim 1) of the study is cessation of fever (<38�C rectally or orally) within 24h of initiation of study drug infusion, which is a dichotomous (binary) variable.  Comparison between the infliximab and second IVIG arms will be compared using a Fisher's exact test for proportions. Differences in the rates between the two groups, along with the odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  As a secondary/sensitivity analysis, multivariable logistic regression analysis will be performed to study the association between clinical and demographic factors (age < 1 yr., sex, ESR, WBC, ANC, hsCRP) and intervention arm, adjusting for baseline demographic, stratification variables, and clinical characteristics. Variables significantly associated with both treatment group and outcome (p<0.10) will be included in a multivariable logistic regression model as covariates.      Analysis of Secondary Outcomes (Specific Aim 2):  The first secondary outcome (Specific Aim 2) will test the hypothesis that infliximab treatment will result in more rapid resolution of inflammation compared to second IVIG as measured by WBC, ANC, and levels of hsCRP at 24 hours and 2 weeks following study treatment. Comparisons between the Infliximab and second IVIG arms will be compared using a two-sample, two-sided t-test at each time point separately. Point estimates and their 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  As a secondary/sensitivity analysis, multiple linear regression at each time point will be performed to study the association between clinical and demographic factors (age < 1 yr., sex, ESR, WBC, ANC) and intervention arm, adjusting for baseline demographic, stratification variables, and clinical characteristics, including baseline hsCRP. Variables significantly associated with both treatment group and outcome (p<0.10) will be included in a multiple regression model as covariates.      Analysis of Secondary Outcomes (Specific Aim 3): This secondary outcome (Specific Aim 3) will test the hypothesis that infliximab treatment will result in a change in coronary artery Zworst score of ? 0.05 standard deviation units as compared to second IVIG at 2 weeks following study treatment measured by echocardiography. Methods analogous to the analysis of Specific Aim 2 will be applied, including t-tests and regression models. Inter-rater reliability analysis will be conducted using Cohen's Kappa statistics and multi-level modeling to measure agreement.  In addition, to minimize disagreement, the Coordinating Center has developed manuals used in previous clinical trials to help standardize performance of echocardiograms and the measurement of the coronary arteries. During the run in period, a de-identified echocardiogram on a KD patient will be submitted to the coordinating center at UCSD and the quality will be assessed and feedback given to the center PI.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	There are no financial interests or potential conflicts to disclose.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	IVIG-resistant KD patients (defined as T? 38.0�C rectally or orally between 36 hours and 7 days after end of IVIG infusion without another likely cause) will be randomized to receive either infliximab (10 mg/kg) or second IVIG infusion (2g/kg).	2	48	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	25	\N	1	\N	Specific Aims:    1) Specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that infliximab will be superior to a second intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion for treatment of persistent or recrudescent fever in children with KD who fail to become afebrile after the first IVIG infusion (resistant KD).

These four sites admit well over 2,000 infants to the NICU each year and we estimate that approximately 80% of families approached for the study will consent for TNGS compared to the poor enrollment rates seen with WGS due to its associated ethical and moral challenges. Informed consent will be obtained from the parent(s) following a single IRB approval with reliance at each institution.      We will enroll 500 neonates from four level IV NICUs and examine the clinical utility and accuracy of TNGS (with WGS to confirm that all neonatal related actionable variants are found) in addition to standard NBS and single gene testing. The primary outcome measure is time to diagnosis and the accuracy of this diagnosis with secondary outcome measures of major neonatal morbidity, survival, and 2-year assessment of relevant morbidities (using parental diaries and questionnaires). All neonates admitted to the four level IV NICUs >24 weeks gestational age and BW >600g with a number of signs/symptoms of an underlying disorder will be enrolled (e.g. hypotonia, poor feeding, hearing loss, etc). There will be no evidence of congenital infection or other medical conditions that might significantly impact survival and long term outcome (lethal congenital anomalies, etc.). Neonates will be stratified by birth weight and gestational age (since the most premature infants will have the longest LOS). The study teams at these institutions have a long and successful history of conducting clinical trials in this unique population. High risk neonates will prospectively receive rapid TNGS (mother- father-infant trios) in addition to standard diagnostic tests with NBS and single gene testing. WGS will also be performed on all infants to confirm accuracy and to establish potential false negative rates. We will then examine LOS and total hospital costs, as well as the time to treatment if an appropriate therapy exists (FDA approved treatment or clinical trial for Rare Diseases). Dr. Davis has significant experience working with international Rare Disease Networks and has access to resources at NCATS (and throughout the CTSA network) and FDA that will be extremely valuable in this study. All clinical testing, therapy, and information relevant to the infant's care will be entered in a password protected electronic database (StudyTrax) as we have used previously.  Finally, an additional 500 infants will be studied with WGS alone by Dr. Kingsmore (funded by 5U19HD077693-03) as an additional group to help determine specificity, sensitivity and cost effectiveness of the TNGS panel.  These infants will also help to inform and refine the existing TNGS panel to include additional relevant conditions not previously recognized. The results of the WGS will be limited to those gene disorders associated with actionable variants in the NICU and no other data will be shared.    Collaborative Efforts: Dr. Jonathan Davis of Tufts University, Chief of Newborn Medicine, Chair of the Neonatal Advisory Committee at FDA, and Director of the International Neonatal Consortium; Dr. Jill Maron, Director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts University and an expert in salivary genomic profiles; Dr. Jerry Vockley of University of Pittsburgh, Chief Division of Medical Genetics, an internationally recognized leader in medical genetics and inborn errors of metabolism; Dr. Stephen Kingsmore of the Rady Pediatric Genomic and Systems Medicine Institute in San Diego, who is pioneering ultra-rapid WGS for diagnosis of genetic diseases; and  Dr. Bruce Gelb from Mt Sinai School of Medicine who has significant expertise in genomics and precision medicine - all are uniquely positioned to collaborate on this translational research project. A Public-Private Partnership will be created with Parabase Genomics in Boston, a leading group in the development of novel genetic diagnostics. Integration of neonatal medicine, medical genetics and genomic medicine is essential in developing the optimal genetic testing paradigm for the NICU. Each center will accrue 125 neonates per year during the first two years of this study for a total of 500 infants who will represent significant racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity and then Dr. Kingsmore's cohort of 500 infants will give 1,000 infants total. Dr. Vockley will guide the genetic interpretation of results, while Dr. Davis serves as PI responsible for coordinating the study to ensure synergy/prioritization with NCAT's six priority areas on a national level as well as interaction with the pharmaceutical industry to identify appropriate clinical trials for any needed intervention. The Biostatistical Support Group from the Tufts CTSI will provide data support (data checks, quality control, etc), and overall biostatistical analyses of the significant amount of data that will be generated. The CTSA centers will capture total cost of care of infants participating in the study vs. standard of care. Dr. Peter Neumann and his team are nationally renowned health economists in the Tufts CTSI and will analyze cost data from each infant. The metrics will include medical efficiency of this testing paradigm vs standard of care in identifying any genetic abnormalities and prioritizing them for inclusion in future testing, capturing cost and clinical outcomes of early intervention including the benefit of widespread genetic testing in the NICU compared to selective utilization. Research results are intended to be published in peer reviewed journals, shared with industry leaders for inclusion in genetic testing and drug discovery/development efforts, and enhance pediatric clinical trial accrual. The geographically diverse CTSA consortium team anticipates sharing data regionally and nationally at medical meetings consisting of neonatologists, clinical geneticists and genetic sequencing experts as each of our key opinion CTSA leaders span the key sectors of influence necessary for adoption of a new technology for improved NICU diagnosis and care.	\N	\N	666	\N	\N	78	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	17	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	9	This is a public-private partnership between 4 CTSA sites and Parabase Genomics who makes the TNGS panel and will perform the testing.	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	Brief Description - This is a unique public/private relationship with six leading CTSA sites and an industry partner,  Parabase. The "overarching goal" of the proposal is to examine the clinical utility and operational infrastructure of  introducing a rapid, targeted next generation sequencing (TNGS) panel in critically ill newborns, in order to  determine if they can provide a more timely diagnosis at a lower cost, establishing the foundation for a CTSA wide  Neonatal Precision Medicine Program. Co-Investigator, Stephen Kingsmore, has existing data on 139 babies from  three trials with a combined 47% hit rate. The Principal Investigator requested help formulating scientific aims  based on the existing data and other early work and collaborations.	\N	\N	\N	Examine the clinical utility and accuracy of TNGS (with WGS to confirm that all neonatal related actionable variants are found) in addition to standard NBS and single gene testing.	2	72	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	110	4	\N	1	\N	Congenital abnormalities and genetic diseases are a leading cause of infant mortality. While routine newborn screening (NBS) has dramatically reduced infant morbidity and mortality, these improvements have not fully translated in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) where 10-25% of all neonates are admitted with an underlying genetic disorder. Hospital length of stay for these infants is approximately 40% longer than those without a genetic disorder. Due to the non-specific presentation of many genetic disorders, affected neonates either do not receive a definitive diagnosis in a timely fashion or are misdiagnosed completely. Our primary data demonstrate that infants with a rare genetic disorder have a 5-year gap between disease onset and definitive diagnosis. This results in a corresponding delay in treatment and development of significant functional disability. Adopting the philosophy of NBS to utilize standard dried blood spots to assess newborns for diseases and conditions where timely intervention in the neonatal period dramatically reduces morbidity and mortality, we have developed a rapid, targeted, next-generation sequencing (TNGS) panel that has the potential to expand molecular diagnosis (MDx) and precision medicine. We hypothesize that TNGS could transform empiric, phenotype-driven management into genotype-informed treatment plans to improve outcomes. A critical barrier to implementing this technology is a lack of prospective studies examining the clinical utility of precision medicine in the NICU. If the TNGS method can detect a significant number of abnormalities in a more rapid and cost-effective manner, it could easily be adopted nationally and then internationally through the International Neonatal Consortium (INC). This approach is preferable to Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) where significant moral, ethical and financial issues have been identified. Here, we propose a prospective study to test the effectiveness of a TNGS panel compared to standard single gene testing and NBS, as well as WGS, in neonates admitted to four NICUs at CTSA sites. This study is critically important and is required to advance the expanding field of molecular diagnosis in a high risk and special population. We have the following Aims:    Specific Aim 1: Determine if the TNGS panel will shorten the time to a definitive diagnosis of a genetic disorder. One thousand infants will be enrolled from four level IV NICUs examining the diagnostic TNGS panel (mother/father/infant trios) in addition to standard NBS and single gene testing. Our primary hypothesis is time to diagnosis and accuracy of diagnosis will be significantly shorter with the TNGS panel. Secondary outcome measures include major neonatal morbidity, survival, and 2-year assessment of relevant morbidities. All high risk neonates admitted to the NICUs with clinical exam findings concerning for a genetic disorder including but not limited to hypotonia, poor feeding, and hearing loss will be approached for enrollment. Infants must be ?24 weeks gestation, with a birth weight >600g and have no evidence of congenital infection or other medical conditions that might significantly impact survival and long-term outcome (i.e. lethal congenital anomalies). Five hundred infants will receive both: 1) rapid TNGS (which can identify 1,000 neonatal related actionable variants) in addition to clinically indicated standard diagnostic tests to diagnose monogenic disorders of unknown etiology and 2) WGS in order to confirm the accuracy of the TNGS panel and document any false negatives. The time to diagnosis of each methodology will be examined.  Finally, an additional 500 infants will be studied with WGS alone by Dr. Kingsmore (funded by 5U19HD077693-03) in order to help establish sensitivity, specificity and cost effectiveness of the TNGS panel as well as update the TNGS panel depending on the discovery of new and pertinent variants.    Specific Aim 2: Determine if the TNGS panel will reduce length of hospital stay (LOS) and total costs. LOS and total hospital costs will be examined in the cohort of neonates identified in Aim 1. Infants will be stratified by birth weight and gestational age since the most premature infants will have the longest LOS and highest costs. Neonates will also be classified into three diagnostic categories: 1) confirmed genetic diagnosis, 2) no abnormalities detected, and 3) variants of unknown significance. We hypothesize that widespread use of the neonatal TNGS panel will significantly reduce total NICU costs.    Specific Aim 3: Determine if the TNGS panel will shorten the duration to a specific therapeutic intervention for a genetic disorder. Over 30% of genes from the TNGS panel are known to have open clinical trials (114 genes) or FDA approved orphan drugs (195 genes). In this Aim, the time from initial diagnosis to the initiation of a specific therapeutic intervention or entry into a multisite clinical trial will be assessed.  We hypothesize that use of a TNGS panel will significantly shorten the time to diagnosis specifically for disorders with current active clinical trials.    This proposal will determine the clinical utility and cost effectiveness of targeted next generation sequencing in a high risk and vulnerable population of neonates in four CTSA centers that are ethnically and racially diverse. This specific approach is designed to enhance traditional diagnostic testing and significantly improve outcome while avoiding the pitfalls of WGS and the inherent gaps in coverage associated with WES.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1000	\N	\N

A lead-in Phase Ib/Pilot will be conducted to ensure that the dose of Ezh2 inhibitor is sufficient to reverse the H3K27 trimethylation that suppresses the IL2 promoter.  The effectiveness of the drug was previously measured in Phase I trials of E7348 Ezh2 inhibitor (Epizyme) in cancer trials that showed maximum benefit to suppress H3K27me3 in skin biopsies was achieved with 400 mg/day, whereas doses of 1600 mg/day were tested without toxicity. This is the drug and testing range we will employ.  We need to establish that the same range of drug dose is effective in T cells inside tumors.  Once this effectivenss is confirmed, we will use this dose with a standard regimen of nivolumab in the Phase III trial.    Pilot/Phase Ib trial (year 1)    Treatment plan: Treat 3 pts on 3 dose levels (N=9) of E7438, 400 mg, 800 mg and 1600 mg orally, divided wice daily, for 1 month.  Eligibility: Patients with PDL1+ metastatic melanoma accessible for biopsy, with TILs exhausted by PD1+ staining and overexpressing Ezh2 (virtually all).  Objective: To establish effective dose of E7348.  Monitoring: PD: Tumor biopsy at baseline, 1 wk and 1 mo, TILs assessed for H3K27 gross methylation and for intracellular IL2 by in situ staining.  A few larger biopsies for TIL isolation and testing IL2 promoter by ChIP/qPCR.  PK: Blood levels E7438 by mass spec.     Expected results: We expect that all E7438 doses will equally penetrate tumor and suppress H3K27me3 in TILs, with increased IL2 in the T cells.  We may incidentally note tumor shrinkage in response to the treatment.     Pitfalls: If IL2 promoter trimethylation in TILs is not reversed, then we will confer with the FDA to further escalate the E7438 dose levels, which at maximum (1600 mg/d) are still 50-fold below the highest in mice without toxicity.     Phase III trial (year 2-4)    The Pilot study will confirm a dose for an ensuing randomized Phase II or III test of E7438 plus nivolumab versus nivolumab alone and versus E7438 alone that tests our hypotheses of a benefit from Ezh2 inhibition.  A more complete reversal of exhaustion under the combination could result in an entirely new treatment paradigm for cancers.    Treatment plan: Treat 400 pts randomized onto 3 arms of nivolumab at standard dose, E7438 or their combination, for 2 months.  Eligibility: Patients with metastatic cancers eligible for nivolumab single-agent therapy in three patient groups (PD1+ melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and Hodgkin's lymphoma).  Objective: To establish effective dose of E7348.  Monitoring: Safety and tumor response.  (The actual number of patients will be determined by the biostatistical analysis under the Consultation services.)    Expected results: We expect that all Ezh2 inhibitor + nivolumab will show synergy with benefit over either agent alone, with markedly improved tumor responses and increase in cures.     Pitfalls: If excess autoimmune toxicity is seen with the combination of agents, then we will hold doses of E7438 and reinstitute with reduced doses when toxicity subsides, determined on a patient-by-patient basis.	\N	\N	630	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	To be requested as part of provided services.

The CRISP consortium includes 4 patient clinical centers (PCC) at Kansas (Site PI: Alan Yu), Mayo (Site PI: Vicente Torres), University of Alabama (Site PI: Michal Mrug), and University of Chicago (Site PI: Arlene Chapman), (previously at Emory University (Site PI: Frederic Rabhari-Oskoui), and a DCC at the University of Pittsburgh (Site PI: Douglas Landsittel).  The CRISP 4 five-year extension will begin shortly (1 RO1 DK113111-01, expected start date 4/1/2017).         The HALT PKD consortium includes 7 patient clinical centers at Tufts Medical Center (Site PI: Dr. Ronald Perrone), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Site PI: Dr. Ted Steinman), U. of Colorado Denver (Site PI: Robert Schrier who has retired, being replaced by Godela Brosnahan), Kansas (Site PI: Alan Yu), Mayo (Site PI: Vicente Torres), Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Site PI: William Braun who has retired, being replaced by Richard Fatica), Emory University (Site PI: Frederic Rabhari-Oskoui, now transferred in part to the University of Chicago (Site PI: Arlene Chapman), and a DCC at the University of Pittsburgh (Site PI: Kaleab Abebe).      This proposal will focus on protocol-based follow-up of HALT Study A subjects that are not already being followed by CRISP centers; these centers are Tufts Medical Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and U. of Colorado Denver.

For Study A, the outcome of interest will be estimated GFR.  We will utilize piecewise linear mixed models with separate slopes for the following periods: 1) the acute phase (first 4 months) of the randomized clinical trial; 2) the chronic phase (4 months through the end of followup) of the trial; 3) the period between the trial and extended followup studies; and 4) the remainder of the followup study. This parameterization will allow us to compare 1) long-term eGFR decline between participants who were originally randomized to low and standard blood pressure arms and 2) long-term eGFR decline between the trial and extended followup.  We will also be able to determine the effect of achieved blood pressure on long term eGFR decline.  Secondary outcomes in Study A will be analyzed in a similar fashion.  We will include time-varying covariates to distinguish the clinical trial period from the extended followup period.    We will assess the degree of lost-to-follow up due to disease progression.  If significant, we will use models that account for informative censoring in order to produce unbiased estimates.	\N	\N	\N	\N	20	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	24	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	All HALT A study sites retain detailed records on participants associated with their sites.  Communication regarding their HALT PKD medication assignment and individualized study outcome reports were provided to all participants in 12/2014.  Further, many of these participants receive ongoing medical care at their HALT PKD study site. Thus, contact info is relatively current.	Background  • Dr. Perrone is interested in recruiting and enrolling previously enrolled subjects into an extension study of the  HALT A study.  • In the original HALT Study A "Blood Pressure in Early Autosomal Dominant Polcystic Kidney Disease, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trial" subjects were randomized to a low vs. standard BP control and to either an angiotensinconverting-enzyme  inhibitor (Lisinopril) plus an angiotensin-receptor blocker (telmistartan) or Lisinopril plus  placebo. Published in NEJM 2014. Dr. Perrone was one of the leading investigators.  • Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) trial, which was an observational  trial to determine how to assess changes in polycystic kidneys over a relatively short period of time (3 years).  Published NEJM in 2006. Lead PI is Dr. Alan Wu from Kansas University.  Halt A Extension Proposal  • Hypothesis of extension study: subjects randomized to the intensive BP reduction regimen during HALT study A  will have a slower decline in kidney function as determined by reduction in the eGFR slope compared to the  standard BP intervention.  • Plan to mirror the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) trial, which was  an observational trial to determine how to assess changes in polycystic kidneys over a relatively short period of  time (3 years). Published NEJM in 2006. Lead PI is Dr. Alan Wu from Kansas University. They are also doing longterm  follow-up.  • CRISP centers - Mayo, Kansas University, Emory, U of Alabama; total n=283  • HALT centers - Mayo, Kansas University, Emory, U of Colorado-Denver, Cleveland Clinic, Tufts Medical Center,  Beth Israel Deaconess; total n=272. Dr. Perrone is interested in follow-up for bolded sites.  • Data Sharing between CRISP and HALT.  • Dr. Perrone will be using the U of Pittsburgh Data Coordinating Center as they ran the original HALT A study and  also manage the CRISP study.	\N	\N	\N	There will be no intervention; this will be a long-term follow-up of the HALT Study A cohort to ascertain whether the intensive blood pressure control arm resulted in a slowing of the rate of loss of eGFR.  These patients will be recontacted and consented for an additional 5 years of follow-up. Patients will undergo a full study visit at the Patient Care Center (PCC) every other year (0, 24 and 48 months) (Figure). Interval medical history, medication use, PKD-related complications including pain, hematuria, infection and nephrolithiasis will be ascertained, and corroborated by reviewing patients' medical records as needed. Blood will be collected for serum creatinine measurements to determine eGFR using the CKD-EPI equation. In years without a PCC visit, patients will have blood drawn locally for annual serum creatinine measurement ('Lab visits'). Study coordinators will conduct quarterly telephone calls to maintain study participation and ensure full ascertainment of outcomes (Phone visit, PV). Data will be collected centrally, managed and analyzed by the HALT Data Coordinating Center under the direction of Dr. Abebe.  The Data Coordinating Centers for both HALT (Dr. Abebe) and CRISP (Dr. Landsittel) reside at the Univ. of Pittsburgh allowing for close coordination and simplicity of data sharing, once data-sharing memos are established.	1	47	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	69	5	\N	1	\N	Aim 1. Obtain complete follow-up of HALT Study A participants in order to be able to ascertain whether the reduction in TKV growth due to intensive BP control translated to long-term improvement in renal function outcomes and the other complications of ADPKD.        Study endpoints:  Comparison of  1) long-term eGFR decline between participants who were originally randomized to low and standard blood pressure arms and 2) long-term eGFR decline between the trial and extended followup.  We will also be able to determine the effect of achieved blood pressure on long term eGFR decline         Aim 2. In collaboration with Dr. Alan Yu and the CRISP4 consortium, develop improved models to predict GFR trajectories and progression to ESRD. Existing logistic regression and trajectory models will be refined and new approaches such as artificial neural network and classification tree models developed, using CRISP data for model fitting and HALT-A data for external validation.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	4	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	272	\N	\N

All calculations are completed using PROC POWER in SAS 9.4 for McNemar's test for paired nominal data.  The sample size needed to detect a difference between proposed discordant proportions of 0.3575% for Seattle protocol positive and WATS negative to 3.11% for WATS positive and Seattle protocol negative is 960. These estimates are derived from prior pooled data for dysplasia detection rates of 4.9% for WATS alone and 2.5% for Seattle protocol alone, with the discordant proportions of test results derived from data reported in Vennalaganti assuming that only 50% of WATS positive and Seattle protocol negative cases are verified with targeted follow-up biopsies to confirm the diagnosis.	29	Inclusion criteria:  Patients:   1.\tBE length of at least M1  2.\tNo prior history of dysplasia  3.\tUndergoing surveillance endoscopy  Physicians:  All participating sites will include physicians who are trained in the use of WATS by the site PI and will need to complete a minimum of three cases to be eligible to participate in this study.

Patients with non-dysplastic BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited. Included patients will undergo both techniques - Seattle protocol and WATS, order of techniques will be randomized.      All patients will undergo upper endoscopy using high-definition white light endoscopy and electronic chromoendoscopy (NBI/FICE). The findings (detection of visible lesions/abnormal mucosal or vascular pattern) with electronic chromoendoscopy will be recorded. Biopsy specimens will be submitted for histopathologic examination and subsequently sent to the Cleveland Clinic for interpretation by a central GI pathologist who will be blinded to patient details and to reading by the WATS pathologist.

In addition all patients will undergo sampling using WATS (order of these sampling techniques will be randomized).  WATS is a novel brush based technique that can sample large areas of the Barrett's segment. Analysis of the thick, highly cytologic, disaggregated tissue specimen that is obtained by the transepithelial sampling brush is aided by a neural network-based, high speed computer scan that examines the entire depth of field and highlights for pathology review potentially abnormal cells based on cellular morphology and molecular diagnostics.	1	359	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	Primary Objective(s):   Primary aim: In BE patients undergoing surveillance, to compare the diagnostic yield of low-grade dysplasia/high-grade dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma between the standard Seattle biopsy protocol (4-quadrant biopsy every 2 cm with target biopsies from any visible lesions) with sampling using WATS plus target biopsies from any visible lesion.

At 0.32% prevalence rate for PD among the population: a market size model of a 50 mile radius of KNI is 3,137 for the total PD population. The percentage of that population that is a DBS candidate for surgery: High estimate 20% (AAN Guideline Summary for Patients and their Families, 2006): 627; Low estimate 10%: 314. Market Size model of 180 Mile Radius of KNI: High estimate 20%: 10,655.  Low estimate 10%: 5,328.  Over the past 4 calendar years, patients with PD that received DBS systems at the University of Kentucky are 2012: 23; 2013: 23; 2014: 40; 2015: 41. The number of women over the course of that time was 40/132.  Of the 29 participants who have received peripheral nerve graft in the two trials [NCT01833364 and NCT02369003], 8 women 21 men. 1 Black woman, 1 Asian woman, 1 male choosing not to self-identify with the remainder white. The study plans for the active recruitment of women and minorities. Retention strategies include a payment of $100 per study visit to cover time and travel. Study coordinators will provide active and ongoing reminders through email or phone conversations for scheduling follow-up visits	39	Participant Inclusion Criteria    Participants must meet all of the inclusion criteria in order to be eligible to participate in the study.    1.

This is appropriate for evaluating disease progression.  Changes in MDS-UPDRS scores will be compared internally to preoperative baseline 'off' scores, where each subject serves as his/her own control, and to control subjects who receive no graft.  As this is a randomized, double blinded, study, Group 2 will represent the placebo group.  The true placebo effect will be evaluated by comparing to a separate group of patients currently being evaluated for disease progression.  This external group is non blinded, receives DBS therapy, and is tested each year for disease progression in the 'off' state.          Given the additional minimal risk of the grafting procedure (based on our pilot study findings) our primary clinical efficacy endpoint would be an improvement in the MDS-UPDRS III score of at least 7 points, compared to pre-op baseline, in at least one third of the patients greater than the same improvement observed in the placebo control group.  The 7-point improvement represents a moderate clinically important difference in the MDS-UPDRS score.

Stage I surgery is preparatory, is performed under general anesthesia, and includes the placement of the pulse generator and tunneling of the lead extension from the pulse generator pocket incision just below the collar bone to the scalp behind the ear.  It is during this surgery that a sural nerve graft will be prepared for harvesting for the second stage of the surgery.  This is accomplished through a standard neurosurgical approach used for biopsy of the sural nerve.  A 3-4 cm incision is made just above and behind the lateral aspect of the ankle.  The sural nerve lies in the subcutaneous space, is easily identified, and is then isolated and transected distally.  A small silk suture is loosely placed around the segment.  The suture serves as a marker for identification for harvesting during the second stage.  Transecting the nerve initiates the injury response of growth factor production.  Stage II surgery includes the placement of the DBS electrode utilizing frame-based stereotactic guidance and microelectrode recordings to confirm targeting.  The DBS electrode will be placed according to standard clinical practice.  For Group 1: participants will be receiving peripheral nerve grafts (single delivery or two deliveries) unilaterally to one substantia nigra after the DBS electrodes has been placed successfully.  For this component, the previously created incision in the ankle region is re-opened under local anesthesia, the marking stitch is identified, and the sural nerve is transected about 2 cm proximal to the previous distal transaction.  The nerve segment is then placed in normal sterile saline and trimmed for loading into the transplant cannula.  The graft, ~0.8mm in diameter and ~1cm in length is then deposited stereotactically into the substantia nigra. One cohort will receive a single graft deployment to the substantia nigra which recapitulates the premise of our pilot studies.  The second cohort will receive two separate graft deployments to the substantia, spatially separated by 4-5 mm in the AP-ML plane.  This represents a 'dose escalation' by doubling the graft material and increasing the potential sphere of influence of the grafted tissue.  All incisions are then closed in the standard, surgical, subcuticlular fashion.  In this way, the study portion of the procedure will not interfere with the scheduled DBS surgery or treatment.  For Group 2: participants will receive a sham incision to the ankle but will not receive peripheral nerve graft to the substantia nigra.	1	75	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	1	\N	Specific Aim 1: Clinical evaluations of the effects of implanting unilateral autologous sural nerve grafts to the SN in participants with PD receiving DBS surgery.  Examine the effect of peripheral nerve graft (single and multi-target delivery) on motor scores (MDS-UPDRS Part III) off/off DBS and medications (minimum 12 hours) at baseline, 6 and 12 months after grafting.  Secondary efficacy endpoints are comparing gait parameters, MDS-UPDRS III evaluations on/on DBS and medications. In addition, imaging studies of dopamine transporter binding (DaTscan�) at baseline and 12 months after grafting. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of implanting unilateral autologous sural nerve grafts to the substantia nigra in participants with PD receiving DBS therapy. Participants who have selected and consented to DBS of the GPi will receive autologous, sural nerve grafts implanted unilaterally into one or two sites within the substantia nigra during DBS surgery. Safety will be continuously monitored in real time and adverse events reported.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	36	\N	\N

0	\N	4	\N	\N	t	The period of time the patient is followed in the study is described below.  These follow-up procedures have been refined and successful in multiple prior multicenter studies conducted by the investigators.     Hospitalized patients: Patients will be hospitalized at the discretion of the treating physicians.  Data from each patient's electronic medical record will be collected after discharge for determination of outcome status.      Patients discharged home from the ED: The guardians/parents/responsible family member of all patients will receive an information sheet describing the study.  This information sheet will notify guardians of patients discharged from the ED that they will be contacted by telephone/texting (we have successfully implemented texting procedure for follow-up in prior studies) by the Research Coordinator one to two weeks after the Emergency Department visit.  The Research Coordinator will complete this survey in order to document any possible missed intra-abdominal injuries (as determined by return visit to a healthcare facility during which an intra-abdominal injury is documented). If we are unable to contact the patient's guardian after four telephone follow-up (or texting) attempts extending to three months after the Emergency Department visit, we will review the patient's electronic medical records and Emergency Department and trauma continuous quality improvement records to identify any study patients with possible missed intra-abdominal injuries.       Missed eligible patients: Although we anticipate that most (74% based on the UC Davis RCT) eligible patients will be enrolled in the study, it is inevitable that some eligible patients will inadvertently be missed.  These patients will be identified by the Research Coordinator (on review of electronic health record, clinical and outcome information and basic demographic about these patients will be documented on a case report form.  This will allow some general comparisons between enrolled and missed patients in order to assess the possibility of enrollment bias.	Sample Size: Minimum clinically-important differences of 5% was specified for the abdominal CT rate from an expected rate of 50% in the non-FAST arm across all sites and age groups (variation in CT rates by site included in the sample size calculation).  A sample size of 3,268 would provide power of at least 80% for detecting a 5% difference in the rate of CT use.  As missed intra-abdominal injuries will be exceedingly rare, a sample size calculation was not calculated but we would expect approximately three cases for a sample size of 3,268 patients.  Based on preliminary data demonstrating a 12% difference in abdominal CT rates in children 0 - 3 years of age, we will specifically enroll a sample to detect at least a 10% difference in abdominal CT rates in this age cohort.  Assuming a baseline CT rate of 50% in all strata, a sample size of 814 patients in this age cohort would provide a power of at least 80% for detecting a 10% difference in the rate of abdominal CT use between groups.    Gender:  We will enroll all patients regardless of gender.  Based on prior studies of abdominal trauma at the participating sites, we anticipate 62% of enrolled patients will be male (male children are more frequently injured than female children).    Age: We will enroll all patients up to 18 years of age meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria.  We will enroll a specific amount in the 0 - 3 age cohort as described above in the sample size.     General health status:  Eligible patients include those that have been recently injured and are presenting to the Emergency Department for evaluation and treatment for this recent (<24 hours old) injury.  The overwhelming majority of these patients have no prior medical problems.     Geographic location:  We have identified six sites that represent a wide geographic location (East coast, Midwest, Southwest and the West coast).	51	The inclusion and criteria are the same as used in a single center RCT. (Holmes JF. JAMA 2017;317(22):2290)    Inclusion Criteria  Children younger than 18 years with blunt abdominal trauma presenting to the participating ED within 24 hours of the traumatic event will be eligible.  Inclusion criteria include any one of the following:  • Blunt torso trauma resulting from a significant mechanism of injury           * Motor vehicle collision: greater than 60 mph, ejection, or rollover           *Automobile versus pedestrian/bicycle: automobile speed > 25 mph  \t*Falls greater than 20 feet in height  \t*Crush injury to the torso  \t*Physical assault involving the abdomen  • Decreased level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13- 15 or below age-appropriate behavior) in association with blunt torso trauma  • Blunt traumatic event with any of the following (regardless of the mechanism):  \t*Extremity paralysis          *Multiple long bone fractures (e.g., tibia and humerus fracture)   • History and physical examination suggestive of intra-abdominal injury following blunt torso trauma of any mechanism (including mechanisms of injury of less severity than mentioned above)    The following patients will be excluded from the study:   • Hypotension (Hemodynamic instability)  \t*Patients will be excluded for prehospital or initial ED hypotension.  This is because the standard evaluation of these            patients involves immediate FAST based on prior work by our group. Hypotension is age determined.   • Penetrating trauma: Patients who are victims of stab or gunshot wounds    • Traumatic injury occurring > 24 hours prior to the time of presentation to the ED  • Transfer of the patient to the ED from an outside facility with abdominal CT scan, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, or laparotomy previously performed  • Patients with known disease processes resulting in intraperitoneal fluid including liver failure and the presence of ventriculoperitoneal shunts	\N	Endpoints were chosen based on the findings from two adult RCTs (Rose JS. Journal of Trauma 2001;51(3):545 and Melniker LA. Annals of Emergency Medicine  2006;48(3):227), one pediatric observational study (Menaker J. Journal of Trauma 2014;77(3):427) and one pediatric RCT (Holmes JF. JAMA 2017;317(22):2290)    The primary endpoints of this study are:   1) Abdominal CT rate: The abdominal CT rate will be assessed as the proportion of CT scans obtained in the Emergency Department on patients enrolled into the study.   2) Missed intra-abdominal injury rate.  Missed intra-abdominal injuries will be defined as an intra-abdominal injury diagnosed after Emergency Department evaluation (this includes any time period after the patient leaves the Emergency Department).       Secondary endpoints of this study are:   1. Emergency Department length of stay; The Emergency Department length of stay is defined as the time from Emergency Department arrival to the time when admission or discharge orders are written.  2. Hospitalization rate from the Emergency Department: The hospitalization rate will be assessed as the rate of admission to the hospital (observation, ward or intensive care unit admission) in patients enrolled into the study.   3. Rate of abdominal CT in children 0 - 3 years of age: The abdominal CT rate in children 0 - 3 years of age will be assessed as the proportion of CT scans obtained in the Emergency Department on patients enrolled into the study in this age cohort.	We have identified six sites to participate in the study.  All sites have an acceptable number of injured children presenting to their site and have agreed to randomize children to receive FAST or no FAST.  Based on preliminary data, the abdominal CT rates for eligible patients range from 36.5% to 68.3% (average 51.4%).  The six cites are as follows:    • UC Davis Medical Center is a level 1 trauma center in Sacramento, California (1,650 injured children/year).  • Children's Hospital of Colorado is a level 1 trauma center in Denver, Colorado (1,600 injured children/year).  • Children's National Medical Center is a level 1 trauma center in Washington DC (1,500 injured children/year).  • Cincinnati Children's Hospital is a level 1 trauma center in Cincinnati, Ohio (1.900 injured children/year).   • Nationwide Children's Hospital is a level 1 trauma center in Columbus, Ohio (1,645 injured children/year).  • The Children's Hospital at OU Medical Center is a level 1 trauma center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1,400 injured children/year).	\N	\N	\N	\N	In the UC Davis pilot RCT of abdominal ultrasound, 925 (74%) of 1,250 eligible patients were enrolled over 37 months (25 enrolled patients/month).  We have selected sites with eligible patient volumes similar to UC Davis and thus anticipate sites will evaluate at least 20 patients/month.  Assuming a similar enrollment rate of 74%, we conservatively anticipate each site will enroll at least 15 patients/month (180 patients/year/site).  Assuming six sites (including UC Davis) enroll patients, the study will require up to 3.5 years of patient enrollment (15 patients/month * 6 sites * 42 months = 3,780).   Thus, we believe we may reach our sample size of 3,268 patients within 3.5 months.  We anticipate, however, that enrolling the necessary numbers of patients in the 0 - 3 age cohort will take longer.  Approximately 20% of enrolled patients will be in the 0 - 3 age cohort (3 enrolled patients/month).  Assuming the six sites enroll 3 patients/month (36 patients/year/site) in the 0-3 age cohort, it may require up to 48 months to meet the sample size of 814 patients (3 patients/month * 6 sites * 48 months = 864).  Thus we will plan on enrolling patients for 48 months.      In addition to 4 years of patient enrollment, we plan 6 months prior to patient enrollment to prepare all sites for patient enrollment.  Following the last patient enrollment, we plan 6 months of final data cleaning and data analysis. Thus, we plan a 5 year study.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Abdominal ultrasound (FAST) safely decreases abdominal CT rates in injured adults but has unclear impact in children as current evidence from observational studies and a single center RCT are conflicting.  We therefore, propose a multicenter (6 center) RCT (phase 3) to study the FAST examination.   Injured children will be blocked randomized (by age cohorts) to receive FAST or no FAST (1:1 randomization).   As the FAST examination is performed and interpreted by the treating clinician at the time of initial evaluation, clinicians are not masked to the intervention.  Research coordinators, however, will be masked to randomization group when assessing outcome measures.	\N	\N	365	\N	\N	48	\N	\N	A brief description of the statistical plan for the study is provided below.    All analyses will account for stratification by site and age group. Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory data, and outcome measures will be compared between the two cohorts (FAST arm versus the no-FAST arm) using appropriate bivariate statistical methods to assess for parity between arms in known confounding variables (i.e., hypotension, pediatric trauma score).  Ninety-five percent confidence intervals will be calculated for all measures of interest. All tests will be based on two-tailed alternatives. P-values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Categorical data will be compared using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for stratified samples. If small cell counts occur we will consider using the exact version of the test. Continuous data will be compared with the van Elteren test to account for stratification.    Primary Endpoint  Rate of Abdominal CT scanning. The primary outcome is if a patient undergoes an abdominal CT scan which is a categorical variable (yes/no). We will use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to determine if differences exist between the two arms.     Rate of delayed/missed intra-abdominal injuries. In our prior multicenter observational blunt abdominal trauma study (n=12,044), there were three patients with delays in diagnosis (i.e., patients diagnosed with intra-abdominal injury in the hospital after Emergency Department disposition) among the patients with intra-abdominal injuries, and one patient with a missed intra-abdominal injury (intra-abdominal injury diagnosed after discharged from the Emergency Department).  In the UC Davis FAST RCT, one case of missed intra-abdominal injury was identified and this was likely a false positive abdominal CT scan.  Although these outcomes are very important, they are of insufficient frequency to be used for sample size determination.  We will simply identify and report any cases of missed/delayed diagnoses in both the FAST arm and no-FAST arm.    Secondary Endpoints   Emergency Department length of stay. Emergency Department length of stay is a continuous variable measured in minutes.  We will compare the length of stay using the van Elteren test.       Hospitalization rate from the Emergency Department.  Hospitalization is a categorical variable (yes/no).  We will use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to determine if differences exist between the two arms.    Rate of abdominal CT in children 0 - 3 years of age. We will evaluate the rate of abdominal CT scanning in the youngest age group.  This rate is a categorical variable (yes/no). We will use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to determine if differences exist between the two arms.	\N	\N	\N	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	The team has no conflicts of interest or financial ties to this study.	\N	\N	\N	f	We anticipate that all sites would be actively enrolling within 6 months of the start of the study (defined as the time funding becomes available).     As previously described, we anticipate that each site will enroll 15 subjects/month of whom 3 subjects/month will be in the 0-3 age cohort.  Study duration will likely be driven by enrollment in the 0 - 3 age cohort.  Assuming the six sites enroll 3 patients/month (36 patients/year/site) in the 0-3 age cohort, it may require up to 48 months to meet the sample size of 814 patients (3 patients/month * 6 sites * 48 months = 864).  We anticipate that once we reach 814 subjects in the 0 -3 age cohort, we will have met the total sample size of 3,268 subjects.	-The goal is to conduct a RCT studying an evaluation strategy with abdominal ultrasound (FAST) vs. a strategy without FAST for the initial evaluation of children with blunt abdominal trauma. The study will compare the 1) rate of abdominal CT scanning and 2) the rate of missed/delayed diagnosis of intra-abdominal injuries in those that randomize to FAST vs. those that do not. In addition, we seek to identify patient, physician, and system factors associated with obtaining CT in patients considered very low risk for intra-abdominal injury after a negative FAST examination. We hypothesize use of FAST will improve clinical care.	\N	\N	\N	Bedside FAST examinations will be performed on patients randomized to the FAST arm by the Emergency Department physicians providing care to the patient.  These physicians will be credentialed in FAST examinations prior to the start of the study as required by the Department/Division of Emergency Medicine at each study site.  FAST examinations will be performed using a portable ultrasound scanner with 3.5 MHz and 5.0 MHz curvilinear transducers.  We will adhere to the ultrasound protocol for the detection of intraperitoneal fluid (FAST examination).  This protocol includes views of Morison's pouch (right upper quadrant), splenorenal fossa (left upper quadrant), long and short axis of the pelvis and the heart.  Images of eFAST (FAST plus pulmonary images) will not be required but this information will be collected on the data collection form if obtained by the clinician. There will be no attempt to image the solid organs, as this is not routine in the standard FAST examination.  All FAST examinations will be uploaded and backed up at the central Department/Division of Emergency Medicine ultrasound server. Image archival will be through password protected Osirix image data management software.  ED clinicians (faculty or fellow) caring for the patients will make bedside interpretations and record them on the case report forms.  The Emergency Department clinicians may be of any specialty providing care to the patient (Emergency Medicine, Surgery, etc). For purposes of analysis, bedside FAST examinations will be classified as positive if any intraperitoneal fluid is identified and classified as negative if no such fluid is noted.   The Emergency Department clinician will also document the location of fluid on all positive examinations.  We will not collect data on incidental findings or specify how the treating clinicians evaluate any incidental findings that they may incidentally see or specifically evaluate the patient for.  Clinical action based on FAST findings will be at the discretion of the treating physician.	2	207	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	6	\N	2	\N	To perform a RCT of FAST for pediatric trauma during Emergency Department evaluation and compare the rates of abdominal CT scanning between children in the FAST and no FAST arms.  Significance: Decreased abdominal CT use will increase patient safety by decreasing the risks of radiation-induced malignancies.     To identify if an Emergency Department evaluation strategy including the FAST examination results in fewer cases of missed or delayed diagnosis of intra-abdominal injuries than a strategy not employing the FAST.  Significance: Physician acceptance of an evaluation strategy involving the FAST will likely depend on that strategy not missing patients with intra-abdominal injuries.

Typically, research priorities and elements of study design such as outcomes are determined by investigators without input from other invested stakeholders such as patients, their families, advocacy groups, and clinicians. The importance of including multiple stakeholders in the development of research study design including COS is increasingly recognized. In addition to the inclusion of stakeholder-supported outcomes, other benefits of COS include minimizing bias and heterogeneity in choice and reporting of outcomes, which can improve the quality of systematic reviews and buy-in from stakeholders in the implementation of research findings.     COS are meant to serve as a minimum set of outcomes and do not exclude other outcomes that may be important for a particular study. We intend to utilize guidelines for COS development and reporting by the Core Outcomes Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative. Recent work by Needham et al exemplify these methods in their development of Core Outcomes and Core Measurement Sets for adults with acute lung injury which included patients, family, clinical, research, and funding agency stakeholders.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	21	\N	\N

We anticipate based on the current epidemiology of MS that approximately 75% will be women, that the average age will be approximately 33 years (range 18-60, based on eligibility criteria), that approximately two-thirds to three-quarters will be Caucasian, and that the enrolled patients will be similar with respect to general health status as the general MS population.	39	The eligibility criteria are broad, consistent with the pragmatic nature of the trial. Participants will meet current criteria for relapsing-remitting MS and will be aged 18-60 years. Patients must be eligible for at least one higher-efficacy medication, have no chemotherapy in past year, and have only limited previous exposure (if any at all) to prior MS therapy.	\N	The primary endpoint is sustained disability progression, as measured by the EDSS-plus. The EDSS plus is a composite measure that incorporates the traditional EDSS step score with changes in two components of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), namely the timed 25-foot walk test and the 9-hole peg test.     Secondary and tertiary outcomes will include the Patient-Determined Disease Steps, the MSFC total z-score, relapse recovery, cognition (Symbol Digit Modalities Test), the MS Impact Scale, Neuro-QoL, social status metrics, safety/adverse events, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of atrophy, number of new relapses or brain lesions, thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer, and number of new medications/escalated doses/other prescribed interventions for MS-related symptom management.	We anticipate 40 actively enrolling sites. 38 sites so far have agreed to participate: Johns Hopkins, University of Alabama, University of Florida, University of Kansas, University of Louisville, University of Michigan, University of Pittsburgh, University of Rochester, University of South Florida, University of Texas Southwestern, University of Vermont, University of Washington, Cedars-Sinai, Central Texas Neurology Consultants, Christiana Care Neuroscience, Columbia University, Dignity Health, Duke University, Georgetown University, Hackensack University Medical Center, Holy Name MS Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mayo Clinic, Mt.

Participants will be categorized as at lower- vs. higher-risk of longer-term disability and will be randomized 1:1, stratified by this risk, to higher-efficacy vs. first-line therapies. We will evaluate if there is a benefit to higher-efficacy therapy and whether that benefit differs based on baseline disability risk.     Additionally, those at low risk of disability who have breakthrough on first-line therapy will be re-randomized to higher-efficacy therapy or to a different first-line therapy. Subsequent breakthrough will lead to switching to a medication of their choice.	\N	\N	352	\N	\N	33	\N	\N	The statistician for the trial is Dr. Elizabeth Ogburn (Johns Hopkins School of Public Health).	\N	\N	\N	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	4	Dr. Mowry (Co-PI) has funding from Biogen and Genzyme for investigator-initiated studies.

We had already been working with Dr. Daniel Ford to centralize the IRB process (SmartIRB).     We project that sites on average will enroll 22 participants over a 10-month period, or approximately 2 patients/month (while we at Johns Hopkins will aim to enroll 44 participants). We don't have major precedent, as pragmatic trials in MS are rare. Since nearly all newly-diagnosed patients are eligible for the study and the site PIs are on the Study Advisory Committee and adjudicated the final details of the protocol, we are optimistic we can reach our goals.     Nonetheless, completing subcontracts and obtaining central IRB approval are two of the biggest barriers to successfully launching and completing the trial. As such, this is a major focus of the requested consult/service.	There is a great unmet need to identify the most appropriate treatment strategy for people with MS, especially early in the disease course when it may be possible to maximize an individual's chance for preventing long-term disability. There is a paucity of evidence-based guidelines to help clinicians, patients, and payers determine which treatment strategy is best for an individual with MS. Making treatment decisions is a daunting task, and the individualized benefit- risk assessment becomes increasingly difficult as new therapies emerge. Without the availability of direct comparative trials, clinicians and patients are forced to scrutinize observational studies that only provide basic insights into what may be the best treatment path moving forward. It is equally challenging to define what constitutes a suboptimal response to a disease-modifying therapy for an individual patient. Clinicians lack guidance on when to switch therapies, so further consensus is needed to determine the optimal time to switch therapies and escalate therapy if an individual is on a lower-efficacy therapy from the start. The TREAT-MS trial will help inform patients and the broader health care community on whether patients would most benefit from early, possibly more risky aggressive therapy or if starting with a less aggressive (and, often, less risky) therapy, followed by a switch if breakthrough disease occurs, is warranted. In addition, this study may help identify specific patient populations and/or short-term clinical and paraclinical biomarkers that are strongly predictive of long-term disability that can ensue from MS.    Accrual of sustained disability is the most feared complication for people with MS, and the patient's own perception of their well-being or ill-being has a profound impact on their quality of life. The heterogeneity and unpredictability of MS, along with lack of agreed upon treatment guidelines, augments this fear, leading to a significant negative impact on quality of life. Even patients who are deemed to have "mild" MS experience a significant negative impact in their health-related quality of life that is similar in magnitude to what patients with other severe chronic conditions (i.e., congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) report. An extremely important goal for any intervention is to help improve or maintain a high quality of life; therefore, in addition to classic clinical endpoints (e.g. slowing disability progression), obtaining patient-reported outcomes in MS trials is integral to better understanding the full impact of a treatment. An individual's perceptions of how they are doing is of utmost importance; therefore, the TREAT-MS trial will capture several important and meaningful patient-reported outcomes that will shed light on what treatment strategies may be the best from a patient-centered perspective.	\N	\N	\N	Study participants will be assigned to a class of therapies and will choose the therapy they prefer amongst from within the class, in consultation with their physician. First-line medications will include injectable (various formulations of interferon beta and glatiramer acetate as well as daclizumab) and oral (teriflunomide, dimethylfumarate, and fingolimod) medications. Higher-efficacy therapies are infused.	1	213	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	16	40	\N	2	\N	Aim 1.

A time-to-event outcome has little power gain over a pure binary endpoint, since its power comes from the number of events (number of uncensored observations). The highest power endpoint would be from a continuous variable that is measured precisely and reflects the clinical outcome situation. An ordinal outcome with, say, five or more well-populated levels yields power that can approach that of a truly continuous outcome. When the original binary outcome represents the union of several clinical endpoints, the analysis treats all endpoints as equally important. An ordinal outcome variable, even if it has only a few levels, breaks the ties and improves power. When there are clinical responses that are ordinal or continuous and one is willing to assume that any clinical event overrides any level of such a scale, one can easily construct an ordinal scale that incorporates both clinical events and the scale. A great advantage of this approach, besides improved power, is that it gives one a place to record bad clinical events such as death, without the need for using a complex statistical analysis that has to deal with such questions as "what would have happened had the patient not died" or "how do I handle missing data when the patient died before the ordinal/continuous was measured?".    Continuous and ordinal scales can be compared between treatment groups using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two-sample test. This does not allow for adjustment of covariates, nor does it properly handle a large number of ties in the patient responses. The proportional odds (PO) ordinal logistic regression model is a generalization of the Wilcoxon test, and it handles arbitrarily heavy ties. We will use the PO model in what follows. For now we consider the oversimplified situation in which a patient has recorded the worst category outcome that occurred within 12 months of randomization. For the actual clinical trial analysis we will use a GEE-like approach in which the ordinal outcome scale is assessed weekly until the patient dies or follow-up ends. This approach counts multiple hospitalizations as having more weight than a single hospitalization. Within-patient correlation will be accounted for using a cluster sandwich covariance estimator. Since the power calculations below use only one overall measurement per patient, it represents a lower bound on the power that will actually be obtained. The power formula used here is due to Whitehead using the R Hmisc package function popower or by simulation using the simRegOrd function.    The proportional odds model handles treatment effects through odds ratios. Let the ordinal outcome be denoted by Y and one of its levels be y. Consider the probability that Y ≥ y for a patient on treatment A and for a patient on treatment B. The odds that Y ≥ y for a treatment is the probability divided by one minus the probability. The B : A odds ratio for Y ≥ y is some constant OR and by the PO assumption this OR is the same no matter which cutoff y is chosen. When the hard clinical events are at the high end of the ordinal scale and a patient oriented outcome scale is at the low end, the PO model assumes that the treatment effect (on the OR scale) for, say, death is the same as the OR for the outcome scale being worse than any given level or the patient dying. When the treatment has a different effect on nonfatal outcomes as for fatal ones, the overall OR represents a kind of weighted average over the various treatment effects.    Sample Size Calculation  As outlined in detail [http://data.vanderbilt.edu/fh/attach/power.html - see sections "Background", "BNP as an Outcome", and "References"], the primary endpoint will be analyzed as a proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model.  We reviewed the literature, including several TAVR trials and multiple national registries, to estimate the anticipated event probabilities for components of our primary endpoint.  These ranges are shown below (Table 1).    Frank Harrell, PhD, performed multiple simulations to determine power based on different (1) sample sizes and (2) different event rates.  The estimates in Table 2 below assume an odds ratio of 0.75 for the clinical events in the composite and assume a fold change of 0.75 in the final NTproBNP (25% reduction in median).  The lower and higher event rates are shown above.  Estimates are shown both including and excluding worsening heart failure as a component of the primary endpoint.     Note that unlike the case where there is a single binary or ordinal endpoint, the combined ordinal endpoint has higher power when the overriding clinical events have lower incidence.  This is because lower incidence implies that more of the overall endpoint would be coming from the more high-powered continuous NTproBNP outcome.  However, the trade-off is that fewer events means that the primary endpoint is more of a biomarker (surrogate) endpoint and less of a "clinical" endpoint.  We want to strike the right balance, namely including "enough" clinical events to make it really be a clinical primary endpoint, while also being conscious of sample size and cost implications.  We propose a sample size of 350 subjects (175 in each arm).  It is important to note that these are conservative estimates of power in that for the actual clinical trial analysis we will use a GEE-like approach in which the ordinal outcome scale is assessed weekly until the patient dies or follow-up ends.  This approach counts multiple hospitalizations and worsening heart failure events as having more weight than a single event and also allows for the assessment of NTproBNP at 4 study time points.  Collectively, this mitigates the impact that drop-outs or subjects lost to follow-up have on the analysis in that they are all still included for some period of the study.  The simulations also assume no correlation between events and final NTproBNP value, which is actually unlikely to be true; a correlation between events and NTproBNP values will increase power.	\N	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	15	None related to dapagliflozin.

Nonetheless, this addresses most of the questions above.  The PI has an established relationship and collaborations with investigators at many leading TAVR centers across the United States.  Those established relationships will be leveraged in identifying enrolling sites.  We will also not have to actively recruit for this trial in that centers will simply seek to enroll subjects undergoing TAVR at their site (potential subjects will be coming to them).  Most of the centers to be included will perform 150-400 TAVRs per year and the vast majority of subjects (approximately 60-80%) will be candidates for this trial.  * Begin contact with potential sites (surveys, conversations, etc.) -- March 1, 2018  * FDA IND exemption obtained -- March 30, 2018  * Finish final protocol - April 30, 2018  * Sub-agreement between VUMC and sites drafted -- May 31, 2018  * Official reach out to potential sites begins -- June 1, 2018  * Central IRB approval -- June 30, 2018  * Enrolling 1st patient at VUMC -- August 1, 2018  * Site initiation completed for first 5 sites (5 center enrolling) -- October 1, 2018  * Site initiation completed for next 10 sites (15 centers enrolling) -- January 1, 2019  * Site initiation completed for final 10 sites (25 centers enrolling) -- March 1, 2019  * Enrollment of 50 -- March 30, 2019  * Enrollment of 100 -- July 30, 2019  * Enrollment of 150 -- October 30, 2019  * Enrollment of 200 -- January 31, 2020  * Enrollment of 250 -- May 31, 2020  * Enrollment of 300 -- August 31, 2020  * Trial enrollment completed (350) -- December 31, 2020  * Final follow-up completed -- December 31, 2021  * Data cleaning finished and data locked -- April 30, 2022  * Primary analysis complete -- August, 2022 (to be presented at ESC)	Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized (1:1) clinical trial including 350 patients to evaluate the effects of dapagliflozin 10mg daily given for 1 year after a recent transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The study will  include both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, but randomization will be stratified by diabetes status and whether subjects will participate in the vascular sub-study. The trial will test the hypothesis that treatment with dapagliflozin will  reduce poor clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.     Study PI is in discussion with AstraZeneca for funding.  After the initial consultation he was planning to provide a revised submission for funding.	\N	\N	\N	Dapagliflozin 10mg (or placebo) (oral) given daily for 1 year.  Dapagliflozin is a member of a new class of diabetes drugs, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.  These drugs inhibit glucose re-uptake in the kidney, but there are several other proposed mechanisms of action.  Empagliflozin and canagliflozin have both reported a reduction in cardiovascular events among diabetic patients.  Empagliflozin was associated with a marked reduction in cardiovascular death and heart failure admissions.  There are also appear to be benefits in terms of preserved renal function over time in diabetics.  As such, several trials are underway to test the efficacy of these drugs in patients with established heart failure.  Many of the proposed mechanisms of action are pertinent to the patients with aortic stenosis and heart failure who have undergone TAVR.	1	252	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	22	25	\N	2	\N	Primary Objective  The primary objective of the study is to test the effect of dapagliflozin on poor clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Potential subjects who have a high pre-test probability of having hypertension (cases) or of being normotensive (controls) are identified from record review of three existing cohorts that comprise a pool 1,336 prospective subjects: 156 subjects in the GenTAC study that were the basis of our preliminary data (26 cases and 130 controls). The additional 222 subjects needed will be recruited from the 530 subjects in Dr. Silberbach's Healthy Heart Study and additional 650+ subjects from the Turner Syndrome Research Registry (TSRR).      Gender, age, demographic group: Only females are involved in this study because the genetic basis of TS predetermines that all individuals with TS are phenotypically female. Children and adults will be actively recruited.  Age limitation only relates to the ability to undergo ABPM (as young as 6 years of age). Because all subjects will have whole exome sequencing we are recruiting only a single racial/ethnic group, white/non-Hispanic, to avoid the confounding that would occur if other racial and/or ethnic groups were included. All analyses will include the first three principal component eigenvalues as covariates to adjust for population structure (race/ethnicity)     General health status: The general health status of our study subjects will be typical for the TS population.      Geographic location: This multicenter study will recruit subjects who are evenly distributed geographically across the USA.  Subjects who were recruited through the three databases available to us are national databases. Therefore, we are confident that our subjects will be able to travel a reasonably short distance to one of our regional study site.	19	Exclusion criteria: history of aortic aneurysm repair and/or replacement, history of chronic renal disease, aortic surgery including coarctation surgery to exclude non-genetic etiologies of hypertension and abnormal compliance, any kidney disease, or abnormal creatinine (measured at enrollment).     Inclusion criteria: Karyotype proven TS. Available preliminary BP data and ability to undergo ABPM	\N	The primary endpoint of this study is the identification of genes that correlate with the deep phenotype of decreased vascular compliance and systemic hypertension. Candidate genes include the TIMP/MMP family of based on our preliminary data. There are no secondary endpoints specifically addressed in the study protocol.  However, a variety of beneficial outcome endpoints are anticipated including:    1.\tExtensive phenotyping coupled with genomic characterization provides a unique resource for the TS community. Rigorous and well-defined phenotypes are a key factor in successful genotype-phenotype studies of complex traits. The level of characterization proposed here not only improves the power of this study but will also increase the impact for secondary analysis for other TS and cardiovascular studies. Those participating in the five regional study sites will cultivate a translational science workforce that will specifically benefit the TS community.  2.\tAn understanding of the genetic basis for the TS aortopathy will lead to novel treatments. The frequent morbid events and appalling excess of premature deaths in TS demands a search for new treatment to slow or halt the progression of aortopathy, possibly through manipulation of MMP/TIMP action (for example doxycycline can increase TIMP expression).  3.\tProof that genetically-triggered aortic stiffness leads to systemic hypertension would be the basis for innovative research in the field. Endothelial dysfunction in small vessels acquired with age is thought to be the major cause of essential hypertension. However, hypertension is common and aortic compliance is decreased in children with TS well before age-related factors such as atherosclerosis and chronic kidney disease set in, suggesting that genetic and early developmental factor are responsible. The studies proposed in this protocol will test the novel hypothesis that genes involved in the TS vasculopathy leading to decreased aortic wall compliance are the root cause of essential hypertension.   4.\tThese studies will foster the idea that Turner syndrome is a human model to understand the role of the sex chromosomes in the differential susceptibility to common disease. The non-TS 4-core mouse model that segregates gonadal sex from chromosomal sex has shown that blood pressure may be, in part, due to X-linked genes that play no role in sexual differentiation (estrogen effects). Yet a major impediment to the understanding of cardiovascular disease in TS is the absence of a mouse model that recapitulates the human cardiovascular phenotype and the TS aortopathy in particular. Dr. David Page has hypothesized that protein function dosage-sensitive genes on the X chromosome that escape inactivation may play a role in diverse disease processes outside the reproductive tract. The experiments proposed in this application will test this novel hypothesis in a human population where gene dosage is uniquely linked to sex chromosome expression. Thus, our proposed work supports the initiative by the NIH to focus on the role of sex chromosomes in health and disease.	Our lead study coordinator will arrange transportation to the closest of five regional study sites (Portland OR, Houston TX, Cincinnati OH, Cornell NY, or Baltimore MD).  The PI is a member of the GenTAC consortium, a group of five institutions coordinated by NHLBI dedicated to understanding the genetic basis of triggered aortic diseases and related conditions.  We have already recruited collaborators who are members of the consortium to oversee site coordination.  In addition, the GenTAC consortium has developed coordinators at each of our sites over the last 10 years.  These same experienced individuals will participate in this project.  The on-site coordinators will collect demographic and other pertinent data, and will navigate subjects to various testing centers (blood draw for basic metabolic panel including creatinine, echocardiogram, and ABPM placement).	\N	\N	\N	\N	Study duration is 48 months.  Our overall strategy during months 1-36 of the project is to deeply phenotype subjects (objective 1 & 2) in order to effectively segregate cases and controls for subsequent WES experiments and analyses during months 37-48 (objective 3.)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	13	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Subjects for this cross-sectional case-control genotype-phenotype correlation study are identified from record review of three existing datasets: the GenTAC study, the PI's Healthy Heart Study and the Turner Syndrome Research Registry.  The lead study coordinator at OHSU will arrange enrollment/consent and transportation to the closest of five regional study sites. Regional coordinators will collect demographic and other pertinent data and navigate subjects to local testing sites (years 1-3). The on-site coordinators will arrange for transmission of raw data to the Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Echocardiographic core center in Cincinnati and to OHSU for final analysis after WES (Year 4).	\N	\N	335	\N	\N	27	\N	\N	Objective 1: Exploratory Data analysis (EDA) to assess distributional assumptions, identify outliers and determine if transformation or nonparametric methods are warranted. Descriptive statistics will be as means ± standard deviation for continuous variables and frequency and % for categorical variables. Continuous outcomes will be compared between hypertension cases and normotensive controls using linear modeling and categorical variables will be analyzed by Chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical data, as appropriate. Propensity scores will be calculated using multivariable logistic regression with demographic (age) and clinical covariates to calculate propensity (probability) of being in the hypertension group.     Objective 2: Subjects will be analyzed similarly for their propensity to be in the non-compliant aorta group. Each hypertensive/non-compliant subject will be matched to up to 3 normotensive/compliant control patients with similar propensity scores using optimal matching to reduce bias due to differences between groups. Aortic distensibility and stiffness will be modeled on the matched pairs using multivariable linear regression to measure the differences between groups. We will replicate these analyses within sections of the aorta to compare aortic distensibility and stiffness within that section. Multivariable linear regression model will be utilized to measure the strength of the relationships of age, blood pressure, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic size on aortic distensibility and stiffness.     Objective 3: To enhance the probability of identifying an exome-wide significant signal a gene-based burden test, the optimal sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O), will be used to evaluate the data. This analysis clusters all variants into genes for a gene by phenotype analysis, which improves signal strength for exome data from smaller cohorts as it reduces the multiple testing burden. This state-of-the-art approach is particularly useful for studies of rare disorders such as Turner syndrome. The variants which pass QC from the WES pipeline will be assigned to their respective genes using hg19_refGene. Variants will be allowed to be in more than one gene since the test compares gene burden in the same gene, not between different genes. All analyses will include the first three principal component eigenvalues as covariates to adjust for any underlying population structure. First, SKAT-O will be used to test for an association with the dichotomous hypertension status. Second, SKAT-O will be used to test for an association with hypertension/non-compliant aorta. For each analysis, a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot will be generated to look for departure of the observed p-values from the expected p-values.	\N	\N	\N	\N	6	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	23	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	This is a cross-sectional, case-control, genotype-phenotype correlation study where participants will be identified from record review of three existing datasets: the GenTAC study, the PI's Healthy Heart Study and the Turner Syndrome Research Registry.

Regional coordinators will collect demographic and other pertinent data and navigate subjects to local testing sites to undergo ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiogram, and blood sample collection.  These data will be collected to accomplish these three objectives:  Objective 1: To identify hypertension among 378 girls and women using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.  Objective 2: To measure aortic deformability by quantifying aortic stiffness, distensibility, strain and pulse wave velocity using transthoracic echocardiography.

The study design compares benefits and risks of 3 first-line (simpler to use) strategies: augmentation with aripiprazole, augmentation with bupropion, and switch to bupropion; and 2 second-line (requires more monitoring) strategies: augmentation with lithium and switch to nortriptyline. The step-wise design matches real-world care, in which clinicians go from easier to more challenging management strategies.      Subjects will be randomized to one of three Step1 strategies:    1) Adding aripiprazole to current antidepressant medication  2) Adding bupropion to current antidepressant medication  3) Replacing current antidepressant medication with bupropion  If at the end of 10 weeks depression has been relieved, participants will proceed to Continuation Phase of the study follow-up and assessments will be performed at 4, 8, and 12 months.    If depression is not relieved, participants will proceed to Step 2.   Participants who do not qualify for Step 1 may enter directly into Step 2.    During Step 2, participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 medication strategies:  1) Adding lithium to current antidepressant medication  2) Replacing current antidepressant medication with nortriptyline    Participants will proceed to Continuation Phase of the study (as described above).  Assessments include questions about medical history, medications, physical functioning, mood & emotions, tests to  assess thinking, attention, memory, dexterity, grip strength, standing balance, gait speed, saliva DNA collection,  blood draws, and review of adverse events.    Those who complete acute treatment and remit will be followed for 1 year.    Randomization of participants will be implemented in REDCap, using a randomized block design within clinic and age group using variable block size, stratified by institutional site and age strata.    Only assessors of outcome measures will be blinded. Participants, providers, and other research staff will not be blinded to participants' condition.	\N	\N	419	\N	\N	149	\N	\N	A priori, specific plans for data analysis correspond to major aims and will be directed by Co-I J. Philip Miller, professor of biostatistics at the coordinating site.   We will follow the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. In other words, patients who receive co-prescribed medications stop randomized medication, or switch to a different medication will continue to be followed.  To confirm that ITT findings represent the "true" data on effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of management strategies, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis that will compare ITT to per-protocol findings.     H1a (Psychological Well-Being): We will use a repeated measures 2*2*3 ANOVA with age (60-70, >70), time (baseline, end of Active phase of Step 1) by treatment group (3 levels). Specific time* treatment group contrasts will compare the changes across pairs of treatment groups. These tests will be conducted with a significance level of .05/3. We will include site as a strata in all analyses.63 For those who proceed to Step 2, analogous repeated measures 2*2*2 ANOVA will be used with a significance level of .05 for the time*treatment group comparison.     H1b (remission): Corresponding 2*3 (age by treatment group) generalized linear models with a logit link function will be computed for the dichotomous outcome of remission.     In the continuation phase we will explore the long-term effectiveness of antidepressants:  We will test for preservation of psychological well-being and other quality of life variables, and sustained resolution of depressive symptoms, by mixed effects repeated measures models.    We will also test for sustained remission by measuring relapse in each arm. Relapse will be defined as meeting DSM 5 criteria for a major depressive episode, as determined by an Independent Evaluator who will confirm the diagnosis by conferring with a study investigator.  We will carry out Cox models examining time to relapse and time to dropout, to examine for treatment inferiority (i.e., whether one antidepressant strategy produces poorer long-term outcomes).  Based on our prior research we don't have an empirical basis to posit a specific arm as inferior.   Therefore, although these analyses are important to our stakeholders, we describe them as exploratory.    We will also examine exploratory hypotheses, such as whether there are baseline covariates which will help to significantly enhance the prediction of response to treatments, e.g., gender, race, treatment site (primary care vs. specialty clinic), social support, co-treatments. This will enhance the precision medicine implications of the study.    H2: serious adverse events, falls, and fall-related injuries are the safety outcomes. Cox models examining time to event (with Anderson & Gill64 extensions for repeated events) will compare the treatment arms during both the acute phase and the continuation in terms of serious adverse events, falls, and fall-related injuries.  We will also compute rates of side effects in each arm, as specifically recommended by patient stakeholders.  These data are not hypothesis-testing, but they support the patient-centered goal of allowing clinicians and patients to know what to expect in terms of side effects from treatment.   H3: Moderator analyses (Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects).  Confirmatory analysis (HT-1): Effectiveness and safety differences between treatment arms will be moderated by age. Specifically, with increasing age effectiveness differences between treatment arms will decrease, and safety differences between treatment arms will increase.    Rationale: Our stakeholders demand that we move past the current "one size fits all" paradigm of antidepressant prescribing.  Precision treatment would greatly improve older adults' quality of life.    Data analysis plan for moderator testing:  We will include the treatment by age group (<70 vs >70) by time interaction to the linear models described above to test for both the benefits and risks for the treatment alternatives.     We are well-powered for a confirmatory moderator analysis examining how age modulates the differences between treatment arms in comparative benefits and risks, because of our recruitment strategy aiming for equally-sized strata of ages (60-70 and >70).  Age will be treated as a categorical variable, comparing relative benefits and risks of antidepressants in those aged <70 to those aged >70.      Here are some scenarios of the types of treatment modulators by age that we will be able to detect with a power > 85% (using SAS's GLMPOWER): (1) If treatment arm A has superior effectiveness over arm B by 2.3 points more than what would be predicted based on age and treatment effects on Psychological Well-being for age 60-70 but no difference between arms for age >70; (2) If treatment arm A has a superior effectiveness over arm B in terms of 13% higher remission rate for age 60-70, but there is no difference between arms for age>70.    Exploratory moderator analyses based on aging-related brain and systemic health variables: Our next step will be to analyze three aging-related variables -impairment in executive cognitive function, frailty, and medical complexity -   treated both as continuous variables and categorical variables, using the same models as with chronological age.    Finally, we will examine the relative strength of these moderator variables by performing a combined moderator test. This exploratory analysis incorporates all of the age-related variables into models of each effectiveness and safety finding from hypothesis-testing.      Notes regarding these Heterogeneity of Treatment Effect (moderator) analyses: We will perform statistical contrasts between treatment arms as a function of thee pre-specified moderator variables, and we will report all of these prespecified analyses, as well as post-hoc analyses, in published reports.	\N	\N	\N	Canada	4	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	36	The research team members have no financial ties or other financial conflicts of interest related to this study.	t	\N	\N	\N	The first patient was enrolled at Washington  University (WU) in February 2017; 15 participants have been enrolled to date. The total enrollment from all 5 sites is 57.   The recruitment rate at WU is 3.75 per month, but the goal is to enroll 8-9 participants per month.  The overall recruitment rate is 14.25 per month, but the goal is 42 participants per month across all sites). It should be noted that actual start dates vary by site, so this average monthly enrollment is not representative of all sites.     Because this study depends on recruiting a very large number of patients found in primary care and specialty mental heatlh care settings, it is very challenging.  Advice and templates of materials regarding getting, and keeping, this study on busy clinicians' radars is paramount.  Additionally, strategies for finding and recruiting such patients from more consumer-facing settings would be appreciated.	OPTIMUM is a Phase 4 study which will assess which antidepressants work best in older adults. The study design compares benefits and risks of 3 first-line (simpler to use) strategies: augmentation with aripiprazole, augmentation with bupropion, and switch to bupropion; and 2 second-line (requires more monitoring) strategies: augmentation with lithium and switch to nortriptyline. The step-wise design matches real-world care, in which clinicians go from easier to more challenging management strategies.	\N	\N	\N	In the OPTIMUM Study, subjects will be randomized to one of three Step 1 strategies:  1) Augmentation with aripiprazole - starting at 2 mg po daily; increase every two weeks (i.e., to 5, 7, 10 mg) to a maximum of 15 mg po daily, based on response and tolerability).  2) Augmentation with bupropion - once daily extended release, starting at 150 mg po daily; titrated after four weeks to 300 mg po daily (based on response and tolerability).  3) Switch to bupropion - same parameters as with bupropion augmentation  Those who do not attain remission in Step 1  will be randomized to one of two Step 2 strategies:  1) Augmentation with lithium - starting at 300 mg po daily, titrated per blood level to 0.4-0.6 meQ/L   2) Switch to nortriptyline - starting at 25 mg po daily, titrated per blood level to 80-120 ng/ml.	1	175	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	40	5	\N	2	\N	The study aims to close the evidence gap on late-life depression in three ways:  Aim 1: Effectiveness  -  We will examine the comparative benefits and risks of antidepressant strategies (augmentation and switching) in older adults with TRD.     - Effectiveness outcomes: psychological well-being and remission from depression  - Safety outcomes: serious adverse events, falls, and fall-related injuries    Aim 2: Effects of Aging  - We will explore how age, and age-related variables (medical comorbidity, cognitive problems) change the balance of benefits vs. risks.

This effort will be led by the UCI Pediatric Exercise and Genomics Research Center (PERC) biostatistician Annamarie Stehli. Reproducibility analyses will be conducted within each cohort evaluating the CPET and MBEB variables in year 1. Power analyses (based on existing PERC data) conducted using G*power (167) indicate that for the repeated measures analyses within each cohort and across site, 34 participants are required per use-group for effect size of f=0.25 at 80% power. Based on coinvestigator Dr. Robert Liem's data (2), 40 sickle cell anemia participants per group in this study will yield 80% power to detect effect sizes as small as d= 0.55 (moderate) and greater than 95% power to detect differences larger than d=0.75.  Similarly, having twenty participants per cohort at each site will yield the same power to detect moderate and large effect sizes, respectively, including an interaction effect.         vRECRUITMENT PLAN    Both the UCI and Northwestern CTSAs are affiliated with major stand-alone children's hospitals [Children's Hospital of Orange County, Miller Children's Hospital (Long Beach, CA) and The Anne and Robert Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago]. Recruitment of children with sickle cell anemia and cancer survivors will be accomplished by working with the respective hematology and oncology centers at each site. Healthy children will be recruited through local schools, community and religious organizations, health fairs, and advertisements.	55	The UCI and Northwestern sites will each recruit 60 participants (50% girls) in years 1-2 of the study and follow    them annually for additional 3-4 years: the duration of the funding period. Each site will enroll 20 healthy    children (who will also serve as a descriptive control), 20 children with sickle cell anemia, and 20 children who    have survived childhood cancers (acute lymphocytic leukemia, solid tumors, etc.) who are deemed by their    primary health care providers as capable of performing CPET. The participants will be enrolled at the Tanner    2-3 pubertal stage with a 50/50 ratio of male/female.    The target population for this study at the UC Irvine site is 60 children and adolescents (boys and girls), Tanner    2-5 years.

Each participant will undergo a series of exercise tests as outlined in Table 1. These studies are described in greater detail in the Clinical Protocol Synopsis (CPS). We have designed the study much like a multicenter clinical trial would be organized, but at a smaller scale. Our focus is on the process of data collection, centralized analysis, harmonization, rigor, and reproducibility rather than on specific clinical outcomes. Each use-case represents a unique challenge: in healthy children, how do we identify levels of fitness that place the child at inordinate risk for threats to the healthspan later  in life; in sickle cell anemia, can we determine an optimal level of fitness despite the chronic inflammation and anemia that constrain the physiological adjustments to acute exercise; and  in children who have survived malignancies, can we detect early impairments of physical fitness that could serve as noninvasive biomarkers to gauge the impact of a specific exercise intervention or a broader but concerted effort to effect a change in lifestyle.

Sixty children at Tanner 2-3 (50/50 male-female) will be enrolled in years 1-2 at UCI and Northwestern (20 without history of chronic disease or condition; 20 with SCA; 20 cancer survivors).

Peak values will be collected at each traditional CPET, and mixed model analysis will be used to calculate the submaximal slopes, accounting for within-subject correlation. Within-repetition distributions of each outcome will be described for each cohort (healthy, sickle cell anemia, cancer survivor) with means and standard deviations. Reproducibility analyses will be conducted within each cohort evaluating the CPET and MBEB variables in year 1. Repeated measures analysis will be performed comparing the means from the first and second repetitions, and interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) will be calculated. Power analyses (based on existing PERC data) conducted using G*power (167) indicate that for the repeated measures analyses within each cohort and across site, 34 participants are required per use-group for effect size of f=0.25 at 80% power.    �Cohort differences. We will explore differences of CPET among the cohorts. Two regression models will be run for each primary CPET outcome: 1) a model to compare the sickle cell group to the healthy controls and 2) a model to compare the cancer survivor group to the healthy controls. Published data from our Coinvestigator Dr. Robert Liem have shown significant differences between SCA patients and controls in a variety of CPET variables (137). These differences translate to large effect sizes (ranging from 1.2 to 1.5). Having 40 SCA participants per group in this study will yield 80% power to detect effect sizes as small as d= 0.55 (moderate) and greater than 95% power to detect differences larger than d=0.75. Similarly, having 20 participants per cohort at each site will yield the same power to detect moderate and large effect sizes, respectively, including an interaction effect.  Differences in main outcomes by site, gender, age, and Tanner score will be evaluated, and accounted for in analyses where appropriate. Hochberg's false discovery rate will be used to account for multiple comparisons (168).    �Prospective changes in HPA and CPET. This study will provide us the unique opportunity to prospectively evaluate CPET and HPA over a critical period of growth in child health and disease. Multilevel models will be used to evaluate trajectories of primary outcomes over the 3-4 year study period. These models will be used to assess: 1) group differences in the observed response (group effect), 2) changes in the degree of response over time (time effect), and 3) potential differences in outcome trajectories between the three groups (group by time effect). Sex and age will be included as covariates. Power analysis using RMASS for multilevel models indicates recruiting a total of 54 participants per site (18 in each cohort per site) is required to have 85% power to detect a group by time interaction effect of 0.4 or greater (taking attrition into account and expecting an intercorrelation coefficient of at least 0.5).     �Linking HPA and CPET. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, range) will be calculated for the CPET and HPA variables. Crude bivariate associations will be explored with Pearson or Spearman correlations. ANOVA and ANCOVA will be used to compare CPET and HPA in groups defined by sex, age, and study cohort. Linear and non-linear regression models will be used to assess the independent associations between HPA (specifically, time in moderate to vigorous PA-MVPA, sedentary time, and CPET. Additionally, the relationship between HPA and CPET categories will be evaluated using binary or multinomial logistic regression. All regression models will initially include all informative 2-way and 3-way interaction terms and, where appropriate, age, sex, maturation status, fat mass, birth weight, and accelerometer wear time as covariates.	\N	\N	\N	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	4	None, in may long career, no drug company ever thought that our work merited a trip to Hawaii or its equivalent...:(	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The goal of this project is to address the obstacles that have impeded optimal use of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in children.   Aim 1 is to test novel and useful analytic approaches to data collected with progressive exercise CPET but that are currently discarded or incompletely examined.   Aim 2 is to develop new exercise testing protocols (multiple brief exercise bouts) that more closely mimic real-life patterns of physical activity and, in so doing, better assess relevant pathophysiology.   Aim 3 is to identify and overcome logistical issues that have limited multicenter studies involving exercise biomarkers.	\N	\N	\N	1.TRADITIONAL CPET (RAMP TEST)    The protocol consists of a ramp-forcing function that has been used extensively in children in this and other laboratories (3). Exercise is performed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer. Each participant begins by cycling at 0 W (unloaded) work rate with a brief warm-up phase. The work rate is then continuously incremented in a linear ramp pattern. The ramp slope (the increase in work rate per time) is determined based on the child's age and maturational status, and a subjective estimate of his/her level of fitness with the goal that the test will last between 5 and 12 minutes. Throughout the test, study staff actively encourage the participants who are asked to raise their hand when they reach the limit of their tolerance. A servomechanism in the electronic braking system of the ergometer maintains the input work to an accuracy of 1% within a range of pedaling rates of 50-90 rpm. We can also perform CPET using treadmills located in our center, in which the incline and speed of the treadmill are calculated to mimic a ramp-type work rate input (4). The subjects breathe through low-resistance valves. Ventilation (V?E), CO2 production (V?CO2), and O2 uptake (V?O2) are measured breath-by-breath. HR is measured continuously and BP every 4 minutes automatically. When the test is complete, we then identify the peak V?O2 calculated as the maximum of 20-second averages (moving average of every 6 seconds) over the last 2 minutes of exercise. There is currently no validated, universally accepted respiratory exchange ratio (RER, V?CO2/ V?O2) cutoff in children for the determination of peak VO2. We use RER ?1.1, a criterion used in a large study by Rowland et al. (5). From the WR, HR, and gas exchange measurements obtained during CPET, the submaximal slopes are calculated using standard linear regression (6). The slopes are proving to be useful adjuncts to traditional CPET peak or maximal values (see Figure 7 in Research Strategy).         2. MBEB-CPET DEVELOPMENT AND ANALYSIS    As noted in the Research Strategy Plan, we developed MBEB to simultaneously test systemic and circulating biomarker responses to exercise using protocols that were fun for children and more closely mimicked natural patterns of physical activity. MBEB has the potential to reveal much more of the integrated biological responses necessary for children to engage in habitual physical activity than do traditional maximal tests. The bulk of physical activity in children does not consist of sustained heavy exercise, rather, as shown in Figures 8 and 9 in the Research Strategy section, frequently changing bouts of exercise of varying intensity. This type of metabolic perturbation requires the organism to: 1) rapidly adjust to the sudden imposition of increased metabolic demand, 2) rapidly recover from the perturbation so that the next exercise bout can occur quickly, and 3) signal longer term cellular adaptive mechanisms that will minimize the threat to homeostasis imposed by future physical activity (the training response).         We propose a dynamic, multivariable approach to analyze MBEB where fitness is described as the ability of primary physiological processes to meet the demands of an exercise task that is changing in magnitude. The project PIs and coinvestigators have extensive experience in modeling kinetic gas exchange and heart rate (HR) responses to exercise in both children and adults. To identify the dynamic characteristics of the primary physiological processes (e.g. heart rate, gas exchange and ventilation) to MBEB, we will use 'white box' modeling (where the parameters are known a priori) such as in the following equation, a simple approximation of the on-transient kinetics:    y(t) = y0 + ?y � [1-e-t/t]    and 'grey box' system identification procedures (7,8) with exogenous inputs (where some parameters are identified a priori, and others are identified by the fitting procedure). We will characterize three parameters: the time constant (t), gain, and rate of inefficiency development of each primary system. A characteristic of high-intensity exercise is a progressive inefficiency (the 'slow component'), which is time- and intensity-dependent and challenges the body's ability to achieve a steady-state (9-12). We have previously identified, in adults, the intramuscular mechanisms to which these parameters relate (13). By quantifying these parameters, we will provide novel measures of physical fitness that quantify the ability of multiple physiological systems to meet the demands of fluctuating sub-maximal energy demands, thereby mimicking the natural behavior of physical activity in children.         3. OMICS AND BIOMARKER STUDIES    In an exploratory study, 60 participants annually (randomly selected from among the 3 cohorts) will have blood draws before and immediately after the MBEB exercise test. Participants are asked to arrive at the laboratory by 8 AM in a fasted state. Following placement of an intravenous catheter and obtaining a fasting blood sample for insulin, glucose, and lipid screen, the participants are given a light breakfast. Blood is sampled before and after the MBEB test. The UC Irvine PERC has a great deal of experience in measuring circulating exercise biomarkers and in flow cytometry analysis of leukocyte subtypes, gene expression, and epigenetic (microRNA) expression using this type of test in both adults and children (14-17).         4. HABITUAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY    4.1. Actigraphy. Habitual physical activity (HPA) will be measured using the ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer (ActiGraph Corporation, Pensacola FL). The ActiGraph is a small (4.6 x 3.3 x 1.5 cm), light-weight (19 g) motion sensor designed to detect time varying accelerations between � 6 g at a user-specified sampling frequency ranging between 30 and 100 Hz. Concurrent validity studies utilizing heart rate monitoring (18), direct observation (19), indirect calorimetry (20,21), whole room calorimetry (22), and DLW (23) have demonstrated the ActiGraph monitor to be a valid measure of physical activity intensity and energy expenditure in children and adolescents.  Contra-lateral hip studies and sophisticated technical reliability studies using laboratory apparatus have shown the ActiGraph to have high levels of intra- and inter-unit reliability (24).         Monitors will be worn on the hip or the non-dominant wrist. After receiving detailed instructions regarding the care and use of the monitors, participants will be instructed to wear the ActiGraph for seven consecutive days.  At the time of distribution, participants will be given a 7-day log sheet to record the times the monitor was taken on and off and to provide information about any physical activity performed while the monitor was not worn (i.e., swimming). Upon return of the monitor to the laboratory, the accelerometer data will be uploaded to a Visual Basic macro written by our project Consultant Dr. Trost for determination of non-wear periods and daily time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, and moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) physical activity. Activity counts recorded on the hip monitor will be classified into these intensity categories using the cut-points developed by Evenson et al. (25), which Dr. Trost has shown to be the most accurate of all currently available cut-points for youth (26).  For hip or wrist data, the duration of specific activity types representing sedentary behavior (i.e. sitting) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (i.e. brisk walking, running) will be quantified using the neural network activity classifier developed by Dr. Trost and colleagues (27).         4.2. Machine Learning Approach to Accelerometer Data Reduction. Pattern recognition or machine learning is an emerging approach to accelerometer data reduction that promises to significantly improve device-based measurement of physical activity and sedentary behavior. Pattern recognition is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with classifying or describing observations. Widely used in business, robotics, medicine, and engineering, the goal of pattern recognition is to predict future outcomes based on previous knowledge or recognizable features in the raw data. Dr. Trost has shown that standard supervised learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees (28), Artificial Neural Networks (27), Support Vector Machines (29), and Regularized Logistic Regression (30), provide highly accurate predictions of activity type and intensity. The energy expenditure prediction errors associated with these models are 25% to 50% smaller in magnitude than those obtained with regression-based cut-point methods.         5. DUAL X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA) MEASURE OF BODY COMPOSITION    Both UCI and Northwestern will use Hologic Discovery DXA. We have used DXA in pediatric research studies since 2002. Several thousand research DXAs have been successfully performed in over one thousand children and adolescents and approximately 300 infants leading to a number of research publications (6,31). In a comparison of DXA and MRI, Bridge et al. (32) followed a group of 8-11 y.o. boys and girls and repeated the studies 26 and 48 months later. They concluded, 'this study validates the common use of DXA in monitoring change in body composition and supports ongoing use in this role in both clinical and research studies.'	2	82	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	70	3	\N	1	\N	Primary Objectives    1.   Pilot test new analytic strategies for traditional CPET and develop novel protocols (MBEB, multiple brief exercise bouts) for laboratory-based CPET that are specifically designed for children both in health and in disease. These approaches are designed to be used across a wide range of child health and lifespan translational research and clinical practice.    2.   Quantify the link between laboratory CPET and field assessments of habitual physical activity (HPA).    Secondary Objectives    1.   Improve protocol and data interoperability in CPET and HPA focused on child health.    2.   Develop approaches for dissemination of best practices in CPET and HPA for multicenter child health clinical trials and application.    Exploratory Objectives    1.   Incorporate promising tools of systems biology (e.g., omics, flow cytometry) into CPET and HPA protocols in child health translational research.    2.   Examine in healthy children and in children with chronic disease the interaction of: 1) the naturally occurring genomic changes during growth and 2) CPET and HPA measures of the PA phenotype.    Major Outcome Measures    1.   HPA and CPET measured in three cohorts, each representing major challenges of child health:    a.   Healthy children (pediatric origins of adult health)    b.   Children with sickle cell anemia    c.   Survivors of childhood cancer    2.   Development of CPET and HPA results obtained prospectively in each cohort from Tanner 2, 3 to Tanner 5.    3.

Patients frequently, in describing their experience after spinal cord injury, relate that they had a period of denial and a fierce hope that their injury would be temporary.  For instance, a patient recently described to one of our PIs that at 6 weeks when an occupational therapist came into his rehab to fit him for a wheelchair he asked them to leave because he felt so strongly that he was going to walk out of rehabilitation.  People after spinal cord injury are also not thinking about their long-term bladder management as necessarily a problem.  In fact, it may be only later that bladder problems become recognized as a primary concern in their overall QoL.    A tenant of our study is that early intervention is essential to preserving favorable dynamics in the bladder with sacral nerve stimulation and for this reason we plan starting nerve stimulation within 3 months of injury.  In fact, we would prefer to do the needed surgery as soon as possible and believe it may be more effective if we do it in the first 6 weeks.  The surgery is reversible leaving only small scars, but even so we have major concerns about finding a way to effectively engage patients so they would consider entering the study.  We are hopeful that by engaging patients and the staff of the RIC that we could gain valuable insight in how best to present the concepts underlying a randomized study and the potential benefits of participation.	52	Inclusion Criteria   \tAge > 18 years   \tAbility to implant device less than 12 weeks post-SCI   \tPresence of acute SCI at or above T12   \tASIA Scale A or B  \tExpectation to perform CIC personally or have caretaker perform CIC             Medically stable to discharge to a rehab setting    \t  Exclusion Criteria    \tInability to perform CIC   \tPre-existing SCI   \tPre-existing progressive neurological disorder  \tAutonomic dysreflexia  \tPrior sacral back surgery  \tPosterior pelvic fracture with distortion of the sacroiliac joint   \tPrior urethral sphincter or bladder dysfunction  \tChronic urinary tract infections prior to SCI  Pregnancy at the time of enrollment  Presence of coagulation disorder or need for anticoagulation that they cannot be stopped temporarily for procedure  Any significant co-morbidity or illness that would preclude their participation or increase the risk to them having a surgical procedure  Active untreated infection  Traumatic injury to the genitourinary system  Prior pelvic radiation, bladder cancer or other surgical procedure to the bladder that would effect baseline bladder physiology	\N	AIM 1:  Primary- 1) Maximum cystometric capacity  Secondary- 1)  Maximum cystometric at 3 months, 2) Bladder compliance, 3) Presence of detrusor overactivity, 4) Volume & pressure at first detrusor contraction    AIM 2:  Primary- 1) Difference in mean SCI-QOL  Secondary- 1) Daily number of catheterizations, 2) Average catheterization volume, 3) Urinary incontinence episodes per day, 4) 24 hour pad weight test    AIM 3:  Primary- 1) # of UTIs requiring antibiotics   Secondary- 1) Development of hydronephrosis, 2) Need for anticholinergic medication, 3) Botox injection, 4) Need for device revision, 5) Device explanation, 6) Hospitalization, surgery, death	University of Utah	\N	\N	\N	\N	5 years	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	15	\N	\N	\N	t	t	\N	t	\N	Patients will be randomized to either standard neurogenic bladder management or standard management plus sacral neuromodulation (via S3 nerve root stimulation) in a parallel non-blinded fashion with the intent to demonstrate the superiority of sacral neuromodulation plus standard management over standard management alone.	\N	\N	448	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Aim 1: All outcomes for Aim 1 will be evaluated at 3 months and 1 year post-operative. Maximum cystometric capacity at 1 year is the primary outcome, and it will be compared between SNM and control arms using restricted maximum likelihood estimation64 under a linear mixed model controlling for institution. An unstructured covariance model will account for serial correlation in outcome measurements. This approach is preferable to a paired t-test or ANCOVA, which would compare the change from 3 months to 1 year and furthermore would not control for institution-related differences.  Our interest here is in estimating the treatment effect at 1 year (primary), 3 months (secondary) and on average over time (secondary), which is straightforward with the appropriate treatment contrasts in the mixed model framework. Additional secondary outcomes (bladder compliance, volume at first detrusor contraction, and presence of detrusor overactivity) will be analyzed similarly, except that a generalized linear mixed model will be used for binary outcomes.     Statistical Power: Sample size calculations for this study were based on a mean maximum cystometric capacity of 220.7 mL (SD=103.3), as reported by Sievert et al, and a feasibility of enrolling 30 patients per arm within the study period. After accounting for a 15% loss to follow-up we expect 25 evaluable patients per arm. To achieve 80% power at a 5% significance level with 25 patients per arm (N=50), we can detect an effect size of a 38% treatment effect (84 mL increase in capacity). An interim analysis will be conducted at 50% enrollment (N=26 after loss to follow-up, 13 patients per arm) accrual, and the decision to stop early will be governed by an OBF significance level of 0.003.  A 0.051 significance level will be used to evaluate the final analysis.    Aim 2: We will use a similar linear mixed model framework as described in Aim 1 to compare the mean QOL scores at each follow-up assessment between the intervention (SNM) and control arms controlling for institution. The primary efficacy evaluation will be performed using a linear contrast to compare the mean scores at 1 year between the randomized groups. Secondary contrasts will evaluate intermediate treatment effects at earlier time points, and on average across all time points. Secondary outcomes will include daily number of catheterizations, average catheterization volume, averaged three day 24 hour pad weight, and leakage episodes per day as recorded with a standardized bladder diary.     Aim 3: Patients will be monitored regularly at assessments described in Aim 2, and incidence and dates of complications will be determined by patient interviews and review of the medical record. Our primary outcome will be the rate of symptomatic UTIs requiring antibiotic treatment over the past 1 year. We will use a frailty model to handle complications that are potentially recurring events. Events such as the use of anticholinergic medicines for control of detrusor overactivity are simply yes/no indicators during the annual period, and are more meaningfully modeled in the typical Cox regression framework for analyzing single rather than recurrent events.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	N/A.

Overview:  Multi-site, phase 1 trial for the evaluation of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA).  12 patients across 6 sites (2 per site) with sJIA or Stills, active systemic and/or polyarthritis related to underlying disease, ages 18 months-21 years, United States, reflective of population with refractory sJIA at or referred to study sites.     Objectives:  1)\tTo design and perform an IND phase I study of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in twelve children (at 6 trial sites) who have had incomplete responses to conventional and biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in order to demonstrate the safety of cell-based therapy in systemic Juvenile Idoathic Arthritis (sJIA).    2)\tTo induce immune tolerance and host reparative mechanisms using MSCs.    3)\tTo test innovative biomarkers that indicate the subjects have had a biological response to MSCs. To further our understanding of immune mechanisms that contribute to refractory sJIA and to demonstrate which of these mechanisms are responsive to cell-based therapy.    Hypothesis:  Infusion of therapeutic MSCs in refractory systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) will induce immune tolerance and host repair mechanisms as MSCs can both sense and repair the damaged environment to which they home. The study team proposes to conduct the 1st U.S. safety CT of MSC in sJIA and to develop biomarkers to detect MSCs effect on early treatment.	\N	\N	\N	Mesenchymal stem cells. Following focus groups we will determine the tissue source of MSCs (bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose). Whether we do a single or two infusions (1 placebo, 1 MSC) has not yet been decided. Based on our experience obtaining an IND for our NIH-supported Phase 1 study of MSCs in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis we anticipate that the FDA may ask us to include an opportunity for measurements of biomarkers from "placebo subjects". The study design may include up to 2 infusions: one group will receive placebo first and one group will receive placebo last, depending on the feedback of the focus groups and the FDA following at the pre-IND and IND stage..	2	165	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	19	6	\N	2	\N	To design perform an IND phase I study of twelve children (at six trial sites) who have had incomplete responses to conventional and biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in order to demonstrate the safety of cell-based therapy in sJIA.

Precapillary    pulmonary hypertension will be defined as at cardiac catheterization as mean pulmonary artery pressure    over 25 mmHg as well as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (or left ventricular end diastolic pressure) ? 15 mmHg.        While clinical endpoints will be the focus of this study, we hypothesize that inherent genomic    variations will associate with clinical response by subjects.

Biospecimens will include    the following:    a. Blood for DNA, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, plasma, and serum;    b. PAXgene tubes for RNA and miRNA studies; and    c. Urine.        Because sildenafil and bosentan have different mechanisms of action targeting different    intracellular pathways, and have not demonstrated any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic    concerns when they are co-administered, we feel that combination therapy is a rational treatment    strategy for pediatric patients with PAH.

Primary Analysis    Time to clinical failure will be displayed as Kaplan-Meier event-free curves from    randomization up to the final visit. Differences between the curves will be tested for significance    by the stratified log-rank statistic, such that the stratifying variables are the etiologic diagnosis    for the pulmonary arterial hypertension and the Panama Functional Class.        The hazard ratio will be used to characterize the treatment effect and 95% confidence intervals    will be calculated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. In case data for some    subjects is not available following loss to follow up, their event times will be treated as censored    for statistical analyses. The first event that occurs will be counted for subjects experiencing    more than one component of the primary (composite) endpoint during the study. In such cases,    all events will be counted separately for the analysis of the individual components.    Any events occurring after the final study visit will be reported as a separate summary.        b.

At the start of the first treatment period, patients will enter a 4-6 week screening period, complete baseline assessments, be randomized, and receive treatment for 3 months, followed by a 2-month wash-out period with no treatment.  With our projected accrual rate, 80 patients will have study duration of 20 months (4 treatment periods), 267 will have 25 months, 2676 will have 30 months, and 186 will have 35 ½ months.	The sample will include adult (n=600) and pediatric (12-18 years of age) (n=200) patients who meet guideline criteria for severe asthma and who are currently uncontrolled or continue to have exacerbations.   Participants must be at least 12 years of age, on a stable regimen of asthma medications prior to enrollment, and satisfy other inclusion/exclusion criteria.	48	Baseline Therapy (2 month):  • High Dose ICS:  [highest marketed dose of ICS available in the US] + an additional asthma controller  (e.g., LABA, LAMA, LTRA) AND/OR   • Systemic CS (minimal dose of 10mg) ≥ 50% of the prior year for asthma AND/OR   • A biologic for asthma.    Baseline Asthma Control:  • FEV1 <80% predicted (adults) or FEV1<90% (peds) after BD hold OR   • Poor symptom control - ACT ≤19 OR  • ≥ 2 bursts of systemic CS (>3 days for adults and adolescents, >1 day for adolescents treated with dexamethasone) in prior year and/or one or more severe exacerbations resulting in hospitalization in the prior year.  Any intramuscular or intravenous treatment with systemic corticosteroids above the maintenance dose regardless of the number of days of treatment.

Treatments will be randomly assigned based on biomarker profiles, and at each point in the study, patients will have a higher likelihood of assignment to a therapy that targets their particular profile.      A double-blind cross-over trial design will be used, consisting of 3-month treatment periods followed by 2-month wash-out periods between treatments.  Patients will be re-randomized at the end of each wash-out period.  Therapies may enter the study at different times, depending on availability, and may be discontinued, based on interim analyses conducted for futility.  Each patient will receive a minimum of 3 test treatments and a maximum of 6, depending on their time of enrollment, and will receive placebo at least once, but no more than twice.      The mode of placebo administration will be randomly assigned for a subset of patients, and masking of treatment assignments will be maintained by matching a patient's placebo to one of the test treatments received.   Placebo data will be shared across test treatments for comparative analyses, but test treatments will not be compared to each other with respect to effectiveness or safety.	\N	\N	45	\N	\N	44	\N	\N	The overall trial will recruit 800 participants with severe asthma over 18 months. In our proposed central trial design, the participants will be initially stratified into three subpopulations based upon phenotype/endotype and randomized, within each subpopulation, to two active interventions or a standard of care arm. If operationally feasible across treatments, we recommend a double-blind design. Interim analyses will be performed at 12 and 18 months after the start of the trial, and at trial completion. If enrollment is slower than projected, we will add an interim analysis at 24 months. At the first interim analysis we will have outcome data on enough to compare standard of care and active interventions. Due to staggered entry, we expect about 300 participants to have between 24 and 48 weeks of follow-up at the time of the first interim analysis (see power analyses below). Data will be analyzed within each phenotype/endotype. Each interim analysis will have the following objectives: 1) determine whether the length of follow-up can be shortened from 48 to 24 weeks; 2) terminate an intervention for futility or efficacy, with replacement of the interventions terminated for futility with new active interventions; and 3) identify a subgroup of participants within a given phenotype/endotype with good response to an active intervention to continue enrolling in that intervention until more data are available. We will test at least three interventions including one which is not FDA approved. One advantage of our proposed sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trial is that adding new, promising interventions during the trial protocol is possible and much more efficient than initiating new, independent protocols. Due to the sizable placebo response observed in some severe asthma trials,17 newly enrolled participants can be randomized to the standard of care arm as well as intervention arms. If there are two active interventions in a given phenotype/endotype, the randomization ratio will be 1:1:1. We expect to accumulate enough outcome data for each phenotype/endotype on the standard of care arm during the first 2/3 of the trial that participants are re-randomized to only active interventions, not standard of care.  Participants who failed an active intervention will not be switched to the standard of care, but will be re- randomized to one of the active arms still in the running for that patient's phenotype/endotype. We will consider the patient to have failed an intervention if the patient experiences asthma exacerbations or the patterns of monitoring markers indicate the probability of an exacerbation of higher than 95% according to our model relating exacerbations and monitoring biomarkers. Participants assigned to the standard of care arm will be re- randomized after they failed or they completed the follow-up (required follow-up length is 24 or 48 weeks as established during interim analyses). Each patient will potentially receive two different interventions during the course of the trial.  Power analyses: To stop an active intervention for efficacy or futility, based on the comparison with the standard of care arm, we will use triangular test boundaries. Let Zk be the test statistics comparing an active intervention and standard of care arm at the time of the kth interim analysis, k = 1, 2 and 3. An intervention will be stopped for efficacy if Zk > uk with (u1, u2, u3) = (2.85, 2.02, 1.65); an intervention will be stopped for futility if Zk < lk with (l1, l2, l3) = (0.93, 1.43, 1.65). For example, if an active intervention is no better than the standard of care, the probability of stopping that intervention for futility at the first interim analysis is 0.79. With 90 participants in the standard of care arm and 90 participants in an intervention arm, the sequential design with triangular boundaries described above will have 84% power to show that the therapy is effective based on one- sided test of size 0.05 if the effect size is equal to 0.50. The sequential boundaries (u1, u2, u3) and (l1, l2, l3) given above are for two interim and the final analysis performed at equal statistical information increments.  Due to staggered entry we might need to re-compute the values u1, u2, u3, l1, l2, and l3 for a given active intervention at the time of the interim analysis as these values depend on the number of participants and the cumulative follow-up time on that active arm and on the standard of care arm. If we identify at least two successful interventions for a given phenotype/endotype, we will use Q-learning19 to perform a post-hoc analysis to determine the best initial treatment, and the best next treatment if the initial treatment does not work out, for each participant. The sample size in the trial (n = 800) is sufficient for Q-learning to identify the optimal treatment sequence with up to 12 distinct treatment sequences.	\N	\N	\N	UK and Canada	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	The PrecISE Network will undertake an Adaptive Platform Trial conducted under a single Master Protocol to identify new therapies for severe asthma that are effective in biomarker-defined phenotypic subgroups of patients.

This network has yet to be established, and could possibly include concussion clinics affiliated with universities hosting a CTSI.  Subjects will be identified at their initial visit with the provider in participating concussion clinics. Participating clinics will collect assessment and outcome information in a systematic fashion (see proposal for details). However, treatments will be left entirely to the discretion of the individual providers at each clinic. Assessment information will be obtained in the clinic with the patient present, while long-term outcomes (6, 12 and 24 weeks post-injury) will be determined by telephone interview (see proposal for details).	\N	\N	358	\N	\N	120	\N	\N	For the two binary outcomes of interest (12-week symptomatic recovery and 12-week functional recovery), classification trees, which are largely nonparametric and based on recursive partitioning, will be used for developing a rule for classifying and grouping subjects as having complete recovery (good outcome) vs incomplete recovery (poor outcome). These methods involve the construction of binary trees, with successive splits of the observations at nodes of the tree according to the value of the "best" available predictor. The regression tree and nodes will be clinically informed so the results have the most value and applicability to a real-world clinic setting. A binary tree for a given regression/classification problem is developed recursively by first choosing optimal cut points for each predictor, and then selecting the "best" predictor for the subset of the observations at the current node of the tree.  The observations are then split according to the cut point for the chosen variable and the process is repeated.  Each final node of the tree results in a classification of subjects as having either good or poor outcome, and misclassification probabilities are readily estimated.  A resulting classification rule, based on the selected predictors, is also produced. A strength of these methods is that a cross-validation procedure is available for pruning back the tree to avoid over-fitting.  First, a large tree is grown until the nodes reach a minimum size.  This tree is pruned back by minimizing a penalized measure of node impurity, where the penalty term is a function of a tuning parameter and the number of terminal nodes of the tree; a higher penalty is assigned to a more "complex" tree.  Cross-validation is used to determine the value of the tuning parameter. It is anticipated that the terminal nodes of the final tree will yield groups of subjects with good outcome that are defined by subject/injury characteristics and treatment applied, but also possibly by subject/injury characteristics alone that identify subjects with a high probability of good (or poor) outcome regardless of treatment.  All of these potential outcomes of this research are of interest. Although techniques such as bootstrap aggregation ("bagging") can be used to reduce instability in tree construction, interpretability of the tree is lost in the process.  Since the main goal of the analysis is focused on identifying determinants of outcome, particularly settings in which certain treatments are especially effective, and not on prediction, such model-averaging methods are less appropriate here. These analyses will be performed separately for each binary outcome.     For the outcome based on time to resolution of post-concussive symptoms, similar analytic methods based on survival trees will be used.  These methods partition the sample into different subsets that have different levels of "risk" of symptom resolution.  These methods can also be applied in the setting of time-dependent covariates40 and discrete event times.	\N	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	28	\N	t	\N	\N	f	To be developed in conjunction with TIN	The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the effectiveness of current clinic-based concussion treatments. Dr. Bazarian proposes a large-scale observational study to determine the comparative effectiveness of common concussion interventions, such as the ones currently recommended by treatment guidelines. The recent explosion in the number of outpatient concussion clinics provides a unique opportunity to study these interventions on a population level. Dr. Bazarian and his team propose to establish a network of outpatient concussion clinics to collect concussion treatment and outcome data in a systematic fashion. This network would be unique in its focus on treatments, and would address several critical gaps in existing TBI networks.	\N	\N	\N	Although this study is observational and without an intervention, it accomplishes two critical pre-clinical trial tasks: 1) It determines which existing concussion treatments appear effective and thus appropriate for study in a future clinical trial and 2) It establishes a robust infrastructure for conducting large-scale concussion clinical trials. Without this pre-trial preparation, any clinical trial of a putative concussion intervention is likely to be under-informed and underpowered. The next planned phase will be to conduct a prospective interventional study, informed by the findings of the current project. It is anticipated that this concussion clinic network will be in a unique position to evaluate the effectiveness of new putative concussion treatments, and make a major contribution to overall improvement in long-term post-concussive outcomes.	1	114	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	35	20	\N	2	\N	The primary objective of this study is to determine the comparative effectiveness of the most commonly recommended concussion treatments on long-term outcomes, after control for appropriate covariates.

Secondary objectives include a) establishing a network of outpatient concussion clinics to collect observational data on patients >13 years of age, b)describing the range of treatments administered to concussed patients in the network and c) determining long-term outcome among concussion patients treated within the network.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	3750	\N	\N

Patients will be randomized to receive either standard care or to the intervention group (Tele-HC model) to assess the impact of the intervention on 60 day all-cause readmission rates.    Randomization  Participants will be allocated to their respective treatment groups through a minimalization approach that stratifies subjects based on institution, sex, and NYHA functional classification.  A second guess probability of 20% will be used to avoid deterministic assignment.    Study Procedures:    1) Standard Care Arm    Standard care is defined as HF care based on current ACC/AHA HF guidelines implemented and orchestrated by a cardiologist and support staff at the participating institution.      2) Intervention Arm    The Intervention arm (Tele-HC) will include standard care in addition to remote physiologic monitoring with a wearable monitor (BodyGuardian®, Preventice) coupled with tailored health coaching.  Details of the remote monitoring platform and health-coaching infrastructure are described below.    ECG monitoring, HR, activity, and posture will be collected via on-body sensors while BP and weight data will be collected by off-body sensors linked to BodyGuardian®.  Information will be obtained via Bluetooth enabled devices and transmitted to a cloud-based management platform that is alert and protocol driven to assist the care team in patient management.  Rhythm monitoring, classification and alerting will be the responsibility of the Mayo Clinic monitoring center in Rochester, MN.  Alerts will be communicated to the high touch care team via phone or the secure web-based portal during the hours of 7am-7pm EST, seven days a week. Outside of this time, alerts will be communicated via phone.     The remaining physiological data (HR, activity, posture, BP, and weight) will be uploaded directly to the cloud-based management platform. The cloud-based management platform patient data dashboard will identify, triage, and escalate actionable information for the study team to review via a secure web portal.  Patient-generated biometric data will be continuously analyzed and displayed on an hourly basis.  Patient-reported symptom information will also be captured.  The dashboard uses color-coded (red, yellow, green) to quickly communicate exception data.  Live data will be evaluated by the care team 7 days per week from 7am - 7 pm EST with additional monitoring and evaluation of the transmitted data on an as needed basis for calls generated outside of the 12-hour monitoring window.      An RN will be designated as the primary coach on the high touch study team focused on disease management including symptom recognition, adherence to treatment strategies, care coordination, medication matters, and problem solving.  Medication matters include initial medication reconciliation and the organization of resources to obtain medications for patients who have socioeconomic challenges.  A RN will also be responsible for onboarding subjects, managing socio-economic challenges, and providing a nutrition and wellness assessment and goal setting.  The high touch study team establishes a patient-centric relationship using techniques of motivational interviewing coupled with a transactional model of communication.24, 25 Health literacy will be assessed using a validated tool to help personalize coaching interactions.  Coaching topics will include the patient's understanding of their disease, establishing goals of health, treatment strategies, medication adherence, and therapy expectations.  As the high touch study team identifies knowledge deficits, they customize the education and employ the teach-back methodology to address the gaps.  The high touch study team will engage the patient in collaborative care planning and goal setting to ensure interventions are congruent with the patient's readiness for change, needs, values, culture, desires, and health goals.  Patient engagement and self-care management will be measured with the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index in a pre-test/post-test fashion at the time of enrollment and at 60 days post-enrollment.    The research coordinator will screen patients hospitalized with ADHF.  Those who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to standard care or the Tele-HC intervention and enrolled in the study.  Demographic and clinical data will be collected.     All patients will be assessed at 30 days and 60 days for the occurrence of re-hospitalization and all-cause mortality.

Subjects are consented in the hospital, upon discharge a home health visit is scheduled to provide instructions on randomization, the use of the device, surveys and health coaching. Subjects are followed via phone call at 30 and 60 days. The study will evaluate clinical outcomes by looking at all-cause 60 day readmission rates.     This phase of the study began enrolling in 2015.  The enrollment goal is 304,  with approximately 113 enrolled to date.  Only two sites are participating.  One new site is pending.  The entire study team meets weekly.    The study was approved for a no cost Grant extension and is due to expire in March 2018.  The PI has submitted for a second no cost Grant extension.	\N	\N	\N	BodyGuardian®  The end-to-end remote monitoring system is a mobile, multi-tiered healthcare platform which links personal health sensors (front-end) to secure mobile communication devices to enable transmission of discrete and summarized physiologic and symptom information to providers (back-end).  The front-end includes an adhesive body sensor (BodyGuardian®) which acquires/quantifies HR, ECG, RR, and activity and has been FDA-cleared (510k) and CE Marked for detection of non-lethal cardiac arrhythmias.  The BodyGuardian® control unit (including sensor) is a patch-style device which can be worn either horizontally or vertically on the chest and is comprised of the rechargeable control unit and a disposable adhesive strip (SnapStrip™).  The SnapStrip™ has four conductive pads covered by pre-applied hydroelectric gel which can be worn while showering.  The system is able to wirelessly communicate with a commercially available BP monitor and cuff and scale.    The BodyGuardian® control unit has a 32-bit ARM processor with 1 Gigabit of on-board memory.  The device uses a Lithium-ION rechargeable battery.  The BodyGuardian® control unit runs approximately 24 hours between recharges.  The sensors collect and correlate three areas of on-body physiologic measures: 1) ECG, HR, RR variability, and HR reliability that can be used to assess skin contact quality of the electrodes; 2) respiration derived from bio-impedance measurements; and 3) body-position along with a summarized measure of activity derived from a 3-axis accelerometer.  The system also acquires off-body measures via Bluetooth connectivity including weight and BP.    Physiologic information is securely transmitted to a remote data storage center (the Cloud) using mobile phone technology as the communication hub.  The system can also function as an event recorder where the mobile phone automatically solicits symptoms (if directed by the physician) from the user-triggered events and by programs which analyze the acquired physiologic data. The secure central data center (the Cloud) stores information and a proprietary mid-tier logic layer supports development of automated alerts, messages, and other personalized health applications.      The Preventice Care Platform is the proprietary web and mobile software which enables the BodyGuardian® system access to data stored in the Cloud and includes server support, web-based user-interfaces (UIs), and access for mobile applications for clinicians.  Server hardware physically resides in a secure SSAE-16 compliant data center.  The server is built upon grid technologies that allow a dynamic increase or decrease in processing, storage, and network capacity based on workload.  Personal health information and clinical measurements are stored separately.      The BodyGuardian® Connect mobile application runs on an Android smartphone which provides data transmission as well as user interfaces (UIs) for control and monitoring.  Data are immediately sent to the Preventice Care Platform if network connectivity is available; otherwise data are stored on the handset until the network is available.  The handset has the capacity to store several gigabytes of data locally when network connectivity is not available.  Data are automatically forwarded to the Cloud where clinicians can review the information.      Remotely acquired data will be transmitted to the Mayo Heart Rhythm and Physiologic Monitoring Laboratory.  This is a clinical area staffed 24/7 by Mayo Clinic monitoring technicians at 4 Domitilla (St. Mary's Hospital) who have been fully trained to use the BodyGuardian® system and are currently using this system clinically for remote monitoring of patients for non-lethal cardiac arrhythmia.  Data will also be transmitted to a cloud-based management platform that is alert and protocol driven to assist the care team in patient management (see section below).  Rhythm monitoring, classification and alerting will be the responsibility of the Mayo Clinic Remote Monitoring Center in Rochester, MN.  Alerts will be communicated via phone or the secure web-based portal during the hours of 7am-7pm EST, seven days a week; outside this time range alerts will be communicated via phone.     High Touch Service  The high touch service includes utilization of a cloud-based management platform built on an open source EMR architecture. Physiological data (ECG, HR, activity, respiration, posture, BP, and weight) will be uploaded directly to a cloud-based management platform.  The cloud-based management platform patient data dashboard will identify, triage, and escalate actionable information for the study team to review via a secure web portal.

Children with uveitis, axial involvement, and psoriasis as manifestations of their JIA will be excluded, as will children with a history of malignancy or recent serious infection.	34	Inclusion Criteria:    �  JIA with ? 5 active joints at enrollment visit    �  Age 4-18 years (regardless of age at diagnosis)    �  Diagnosis within the prior 12 months    �  Enrollment in CARRA Registry (can be at study enrollment)      Allowed prior treatment:    �  Prior treatment with oral glucocorticoids permitted if < 4 weeks duration and discontinued ? 1 week prior to enrollment    �  Prior intraarticular glucocorticoid injection allowed if <=2 joints and > 2 months prior to enrollment    �  Current methotrexate use if duration at the time of enrollment is <=2 weeks        Exclusion Criteria:      Systemic JIA as defined by 2004 ILAR criteria6    �  Sacroiliitis (clinical or radiographic)    �  Psoriasis    �  Dactylitis    �  History of uveitis or currently active uveitis    �  Prior treatment with systemic conventional or biologic DMARD(s) except for as noted in inclusion criteria    �  History of malignancy or known/suspected malignancy    �  Active infection requiring IV antibiotics within 1 month prior to enrollment or PO antibiotics within 2 weeks of enrollment    �  Current or planned pregnancy during the subsequent 12 months	\N	Pairwise comparison of MTX with the 3 biologics for the outcome of clinical inactive disease at 12 month.

It will be the first JIA clinical trial to include multiple biologic agents. COMPARE-JIA will also enable exploratory subgroup analyses, defined a priori, to provide preliminary data regarding treatment response in specific subgroups of patients (e.g. rheumatoid factor positive versus negative). This trial also seeks to identify predictors, both clinical and biologic, or combinations of predictors, of nonresponse and response to therapy. The identification of predictors of response and non-response will provide valuable information to physicians and patients making initial biologic treatment choices, making it possible to determine early in the treatment course whether the patient is likely to respond or would benefit from a medication change. Identifying predictors of response and non-response is an important step towards tailoring treatment to individual patient characteristics, using precision medicine approaches to guide JIA treatment.    The trial design has innovative pragmatic features, including: 1) broad inclusion criteria enhancing generalizability, since patients will have a wider range of disease activity and clinical manifestations than generally allowed in traditional clinical trials; and 2) clinical and laboratory assessments mirroring routine clinical care to facilitate patient enrollment and translation of the study results into real-world practice.    During the course of this 12-month planning phase, we are optimizing and finalizing all components necessary to conduct COMPARE-JIA, a multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of biologic medications with different mechanisms of action plus MTX to MTX alone as first-line therapy for poly-JIA. In this trial, children with poly-JIA will be randomized to one of 4 biologically distinct treatments (MTX, MTX + certolizumab, MTX + tocilizumab, MTX + abatacept). The primary outcome will be the ACR provisional criteria for CID at 12 months. Exams by blinded joint assessors will be performed at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12- months. Importantly, the study is also powered to compare the proportion of children with CID at 6 months following enrollment. Blood samples will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months for later analyses to identify biologic predictors of response and non-response to therapy.     This trial will be conducted with the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) research network, utilizing the existing patient Registry infrastructure for data collection.    Please see attached proposal for additional details regarding study outcomes, and visit schedule and assessments.	\N	\N	672	\N	\N	142	\N	\N	(To be refined further in the planning stage):  The primary comparison (biologic therapies compared to MTX monotherapy for proportion of patients achieving CID at 12 months) will be made using Dunnett's test and will compare each biologic arm versus MTX in a pairwise fashion, using a critical chi-squared of 5.5178 or, equivalently, an alpha-level of 0.01882.  Study-side alpha-level will be 0.05. Because of relatively small sample sizes in each arm, comparisons will use Fisher's mid-p test will power close to that of standard chi-square test, but persevering the nominal alpha level. Confidence intervals will be calculated using unconditional exact methods.      Based on current sample size calculations (below) we estimate a required sample size of 50 patients per arm with an additional 15% recruited to account for potential drop-outs. The final estimated sample size is 230. Please see attached Research Plan for details of the sample size calculation.	\N	f	\N	\N	28	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	8	Dr. Schanberg has served on a DSMB for certolizumab and currently serves as a PI for the CARRA Registry.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Enrollment plan will be finalized during the planning phase.	Background:  �\tChildren with poly-Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)  (5+ joints involved) have refractory disease, poorer health related quality of life (HRQoL), and poorer functional outcomes than children with fewer involved joints  �\tThe current approach for treatment of poly-JIA  is 'trial and error' of different therapeutic agents during which a window of opportunity for limiting disease activity or altering the disease course may be missed    The proposed randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of 3 biologically distinct treatments (certolizumab (CTZ), abatacept (ABA), and tocilizumab (TCZ)), each administered in combination with methotrexate (MTX) to MTX monotherapy, in achieving clinical inactive disease (CID) at 12 months in children with poly-JIA.  Hypothesis: Biologic treatment started as initial therapy in poly-JIA is more effective than MTX monotherapy in achieving CID at 12 months.	\N	\N	\N	Eligible participants will be randomized at the patient level to one of four treatment arms below in a 1:1:1:1 scheme:    1.     SQ MTX .5 mg/kg/dose once weekly (maximum 25 mg per dose)    2.     SQ MTX + SQ certolizumab every 2 or 4 weeks depending on weight    3.     SQ MTX + SQ abatacept weekly    4.     SQ MTX+ SQ tocilizumab every 2 or 3 weeks depending on weight      Each medication will be given subcutaneously (SQ). Providers will have the option of giving patients a pre-defined course of oral prednisone at study entry if it is consistent with their usual practice. Randomization will be stratified based on whether or not patients received prednisone.	2	51	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	46	30	\N	1	\N	Planning for a trial that has the following aims:    Primary Aim. Compare the effectiveness of 3 biologically distinct treatments (certolizumab, abatacept, and tocilizumab administered in combination with methotrexate; MTX) to MTX monotherapy, in achieving clinical inactive disease (CID) at 12 months in children with poly-JIA in the context of a randomized controlled trial.    Hypothesis: Biologic treatment started as initial therapy in poly-JIA is more effective in achieving CID at 12 months than MTX monotherapy.    Secondary Aim. Compare the effectiveness of 3 biologically distinct treatments (certolizumab, abatacept, and tocilizumab administered in combination with MTX) to MTX monotherapy, in achieving clinical inactive disease (CID) at 6 months in children with poly-JIA in the context of a randomized controlled trial.    Hypothesis: Biologic treatment started as initial therapy in poly-JIA is more effective in achieving CID at 6 months than MTX monotherapy.    Exploratory Aims. 1. Compare proportions of patients achieving CID between the biologic therapies at 6 and 12 months. 2. Identify clinical and biologic predictors of achieving CID at 12 months and non-response by analyzing individual patient trajectories.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	230	\N	\N

Through their community engagement, integrating special population, and informatics components, CTSA's at the identified sites and perhaps throughout the consortium could be exceptional resources.The sites chosen have CTSAs and will provide strong access to both European ancestry populations and peoples of Asian, Hispanic, and African-American descent.

Sinai BioMe, Northwestern's NUGene, etc  e.\tReferral from existing diabetes trials (DPP, Look AHEAD, GRADE, etc)    Once enrolled and consented, an expert working group will choose subjects recruited with high potential for rare atypical forms of diabetes. They will review the history, physical and laboratory data along with family history data and select subjects for call-back. Samples will then be collected for DNA, a small number of key lab tests, urine for c-peptide analysis, and consent for contacting them will be confirmed. Depending on family history, additional family members may also be enrolled. Genetic testing will include whole exome and genotyping (GWAS). Initial bioinformatics will determine a risk score for T1diabetes, and sequences for  20 or more known diabetes related genes will be analyzed. Samples will be sent for determining glucose, A1c, other standard lab tests, urine for c-peptide/creatinine ratio and several other tests. Results will again be reviewed by experts in diabetes and genetics. A subset of these subjects will be set aside for further phenotyping and/or whole genome sequencing. The results of these studies will be made available in "honest broker" deidentifed database for further studies by the research community upon application.	\N	\N	375	\N	\N	18	\N	\N	We have consider various ways to do evaluate samples size needed:  1. Have experienced clinicians in academic practices record the number of patients that say in a 1-2 week period whom they would consider atypical.   2. Evaluate the number of subjects in an existing monogenic registry designed to identify subjects with MODY and monogenic diabetes who do not yet have a genetic diabetes to explain their diabetes.   3. Use key search terms to search EHRs such as the BioVu at Vanderbilt to estimate the number of patients with diabetes who might have atypical features.     From these estimates, it is possible that 5% of all potential subjects with diabetes might have atypical features. This is a large number- as many as 1-3 million people in the United States. However based on estimates of existing forms of monogenic diabetes, such as the percentage of people under age 45 with one of the more "common" forms of MODY, the total number of such known atypical forms in aggregate is estimated as between 200,000 - 1 million  - and this would be the composite of all the known genes. None of them by themselves would be much more than 200,000 individuals, such as in the case of glucokinase mutations. This suggests that the effort to recruit as many as 500-1000 highly selected subjects per year is likely to yield some modest number of atypical forms.	\N	\N	\N	\N	24	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	Establish center for study of atypical diabetes;  PI is an established investigator in this area with extensive funding.

There is more than sufficient access to an eligible patient population due to the large volume of patients receiving care through the PECARN network and Emory/CHOA.      Although we saw a trend towards decreased LOS, the Morris 2013 study was not sufficiently powered to identify a statistically significant difference.  Patients were consented within 24 hours of ED arrival, with mean time to study drug delivery of ~20 hours. Despite this delay, a trend towards decreased LOS, & a significant decrease in opioid use is observed in the arginine arm.  Therefore, a more rapid initiation of arginine therapy after ED presentation, added to standard pain management may increase the detectable mean difference in LOS between the treatment and placebo arms.  This study will be sufficiently powered to detect a clinically significant decrease in LOS (as a surrogate for time-to-crisis-resolution). Total opioid use correlated strongly to LOS (r=0.86, p<0.0001). LOS strongly correlates to time-to-crisis-resolution (r=0.93, p<0.0001; Greg Kato unpublished data from DeNOVO trial, personal communication). Including interim analysis sample size inflammation & drop-out rate of 10%, the multi-center clinical trial will require enrollment of 360 children total with VOE.

Descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency & dispersion will be computed for continuous data such as age. Frequency distributions will be estimated for categorical data such as sex. To assure a balanced random treatment assignment, we will examine each treatment and control in relationship to demographic (e g., sex) and medical characteristic (e g., underlying disease, history of VOE admissions) variables using the appropriate parametric (e.g., t-test) or nonparametric test (e.g., chi-square, Wilcoxon tests).  Interim Analysis: Interim analysis of safety data as well as data on the primary endpoint &, as necessary, other endpoints, will be undertaken by the DSMB & DCC, after randomization of approximately 150 patients, and again after 250 patients. The study may be stopped early if a statistically significant decrease in time-to-crisis-resolution is noted.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Parenteral L-arginine HCL is only made by 1 Biopharma company: Pfizer.

Important secondary outcomes include  length of hospital stay, total parenteral opioid use (mg/kg morphine equivalents), pain scores, discharge rate from the emergency department, and health-related quality of life outcomes of children with SCD presenting with VOE.     Aim 2: Safety    To determine the safety profile of IV L-arginine in the treatment of acute VOE in children with SCD. In particular, renal and hepatic function will be monitored, together with rate of acute chest syndrome, requirement for blood transfusion, oxygen use during study drug delivery, and 72-hour and 28-day return visits to the emergency department or hospital admission.      Aim 3: Exploratory     To further characterize alterations in the arginine metabolome and mitochondrial dysfunction in children with SCD and VOE, and evaluate how it is impacted by arginine therapy. This aim will also establish a SCD-VOE biorepository to explore future mechanistic studies.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	360	\N	\N

Objectives:  Primary Objective:  To demonstrate the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics for controlling neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD.  H1: Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine) will reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD patients regardless of patient exposure to VMAT2 inhibitors.    Secondary objective:  Exploratory analysis of antipsychotic effect on chorea scores in HD patients.

Site investigators will determine which of the three antipsychotics to give the patient based on individual patient characteristics. Participants will be titrated over 4 weeks, assuming tolerance of medication, to a total dose of aripiprazole 15 mg daily, risperidone 2 mg twice daily, or olanzapine 15 mg at night. During titration, the physician may choose to reduce the dose to the previous dose in the event that a higher dose results in an adverse event attributable to that medication.	1	333	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	8	10	\N	\N	\N	The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics for controlling neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD.

The two arms are: (1) targeted TXA use in subjects with evidence of hyperfibrinolysis as demonstrated by a lysis time of  ≥ 3.0 on rapid thromboelastography (TEG) and (2) empiric TXA use (treatment not directed by TEG testing).   Randomization will be performed using 1:1 allocation using permuted blocks within each site.  Randomization sequence will be generated prior to the start of the study and will be filed using a series of numbered, opaque envelopes.  Envelopes with study arm assignment will be stored in close proximity to trauma resuscitation areas in study site EDs.  Treatment allocation will be revealed to the clinical care team after eligibility for enrollment has been determined to be appropriate by asking a member of the care team to open the next sequentially numbered envelope.  The number of the envelope and study arm assignment will be recorded in a log after opening the envelope.  The clinical team will then be directed to use the assigned intervention arm.  Compliance with enrollment of eligible patients and study intervention will be monitored.    Interventional arms will be open-label and neither the subject nor the care team will be blinded to the allocated treatment assignment.  Blinding study intervention is not feasible given the differences in timing of TXA administration between study arms. However, randomization following study enrollment will help to minimize selection bias that might occur due to pre-enrollment awareness of study group assignment.  We will provide targeted education if <90% of eligible patients at a site are enrolled/randomized over one month.  If <80% of eligible patients are enrolled/randomized over two consecutive months, the site will be placed on monitored probation with removal of the site if enrollment/randomization does not increase to >80% within two additional months.  Study intervention cross-over between arms (i.e., use of TXA prior to TEG results after randomization to the targeted intervention arm and use of TEG-directed TXA adminstration after randomization to the empiric intervention arm) will be monitored by study personnel to ensure that at least 75% of subjects receive the intervention assisned with randomization. If <80% of study patients meet this minimum criteria over one month, targeted education to treating clinicians will be provided.  If <70% of eligible patients meet this criteria over two consecutive months, the site will be placed on monitored probation with removal of the site if >75% compliance with study intervention is not achieved within two additional months.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Eligible subjects will be identified upon arrival in the emergency department. Subjects will be randomized to one of two intervention arms: targeted TXA administration or empiric TXA administration. Subjects randomized to the targeted arm will have a rapid thromboelastography (TEG) conducted immediately after study enrollment. TXA will be administered only if the rapid TEG results demonstrate hyperfibrinolysis (lysis time ≥ 3.0). Subjects randomized to the empiric TXA administration will receive TXA immediately after study enrollment. For both study arms, TXA will be administered as a bolus infusion of 1000 mg iv over 10 minutes followed by maintenance infusion of 1000 mg over 8 hours.The trial will be conducted at Level 1 or 2 trauma centers that are mandated to maintain standardized trauma registries.  These registries include clinical variables (GCS scores, vital signs, injuries) and outcome measures (mortality, hospital length of stay, blood transfusions).  We will leverage these ongoing trauma registries and the primary data sources for clinical variables and outcome measures.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Subjects will be randomized to one of two intervention arms: targeted TXA administration or empiric TXA administration.

In many ways, getting involved with funded R34 is an almost ideal scenario for us to have an impact on the ultimate larger trial. This opportunity also provides a chance to involve several TICs and the RIC in consultation as the protocol is fully  developed over a several year period.     1. Get the primary institution onto SMART IRB, as well as the proposed sites for the R34 pilot.  Marginal cost = zero, because we are tasked with getting them onto SMART IRB anyway.  2. For the R34 pilot, we can act as the cIRB, we can teach the primary site how it can use  SMART IRB to be the cIRB itself, or they can go with distributed IRB for their pilot since they are  already funded. But I know that they want to use a cIRB, even though they are not required.  3. Engage the investigators with expertise from our TIC as well as the other two TICs, for purposes of study design innovation. This could include one or two face to face meetings with detailed consultation as the investigators plan the ultimate trial.  4. Engage the investigators with a consultation from the RIC, with goal of identifying CTSA affiliates with the largest number of applicable patients, with the goal of identifying the best site  investigators at the best sites so that the ultimate trial will be rapidly accrued.  5. Engage the investigators with the opportunity to bring the ultimate trial to the Trial Innovation Network as a proposal, using the intake procedures that are in place 12 to 18 months from now.  6. After identification of the clinical sites is accomplished, get those sites onto SMART IRB in anticipation of being the cIRB for the ultimate clinical trial, IF the NEC determines that this trial  should receive support and be conducted within the Trial Innovation Network.    Anticipated benefits to the Network: Getting involved with funded R34 is an almost ideal scenario for us to have an impact on the ultimate larger trial.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N

Extrapolation of a 12-month period would yield 20 patients per year of RND at UVA of 1.6.  Depending on each site, enrollment will average between15-30 patients a year, translating into an RND/site per month of 1.25 to 2.5 patients.      As the University of Virginia has performed a phase 1 safety study of 31 patients, they will likely be the first center started following funding and after the lot of bovine lactoferrin meets prescreening microbial and endotoxin testing criteria.  All sites should be enrolling within 4-6 months of study activation.  From the phase 1 study, 31 patients <1500 grams where enrolled over 9 months, with half of them being <1000 grams, so approximately 20 of 50 infants <1000 grams or 40% per year consented and enrolled.      Currently we have 6 centers, increasing center number would increase enrollment rates leading to meeting enrollment goals sooner and having study results sooner in this important area of infection prevention.	Overview:  Phase 2B multicenter prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bovine lactoferrin supplementation for the prevention of late-onset BSIs and NEC in 284 preterm infants admitted to six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).      Objectives:  •\tAim 1.  To study the safety and efficacy of lactoferrin, we will perform a multicenter prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in 284 preterm infants <1000 grams and <8 days old admitted to six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) under strict FDA guideline and an IND.  Groups will receive study treatment (300 mg/kg/day of bovine lactoferrin or placebo-sterile water) with feedings twice a day from enrollment until 40 weeks PMA, discharge/transfer or death. Primary endpoint for the study will be BSI or NEC after 3 days of age while receiving study treatment.  Safety will be assessed throughout the study and post discharge parent surveys of infant feeding type (human milk, formula type, and cow's milk) during the first two years.  Lactoferrin levels will be measured in saliva, scavenged blood samples, and in maternal or donor breast milk when on full enteral feeding volumes for one week around week 3-4.       •\tAim 2.  To examine the effects of lactoferrin on postnatal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) acquisition.     •\tAim 3.  To investigate the effects of lactoferrin on growth and development. Growth during study solution administration and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age will be assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II).      •\tAim 4.  To examine the effects of lactoferrin on the stool microbiome.     Primary endpoint:   •\tBSI or NEC (Stage 2 or greater) after 3 days of age while receiving study treatment.    Secondary endpoints:   •\tUrinary tract infections  •\tSkin and soft tissue infections  •\tAntibiotic days  •\tCMV acquisition  •\tMicrobiome  •\tGrowth  •\tDays to full enteral feedings  •\tLength of stay  •\tHospital costs  •\tNeurodevelopmental outcome  •\tMortality	\N	\N	\N	We will conduct a multicenter prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in 284 preterm infants admitted to six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the United States.  The study will be performed under an Investigation New Drug (IND) application.  Prior to enrollment, written informed consent will be obtained from each infant's parent or guardian. The protocol will be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each hospital or a central IRB. We will enroll 142 infants in the lactoferrin group (300 mg/kg daily dosing) and 142 in the placebo group. Study solution (lactoferrin or placebo) will be given enterally by a feeding tube or by mouth depending how each infant is feeding. Groups will receive treatment from enrollment until 40 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA), discharge, transfer or death.    Lactoferrin (BioFerrin2000) will be provided for the study by Glanbia Nutritionals with additional quality control testing performed on each lot for microbial and endotoxin content prior to lot use.  Lactoferrin study solution will be prepared under aseptic conditions in each participant center's pharmacy by adding sterile water to dry lactoferrin powder.  Placebo will be an equivalent volume of sterile water alone. To prevent any contamination during compounding, the study solution will be prepared aseptically using sterile containers and syringes by investigational pharmacists at each site. Infants will be assessed for an issues following administration. Each infant will receive the study solution just prior to the scheduled feeding of expressed breast milk, donor milk or formula if feeding, or given alone if not feeding.	2	215	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	28	6	\N	2	\N	Aim 1.  To study the safety and efficacy of lactoferrin, we will perform a multicenter prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in 284 preterm infants <1000 grams and <8 days old admitted to six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) under strict FDA guideline and an IND.  Groups will receive study treatment (300 mg/kg/day of bovine lactoferrin or placebo-sterile water) with feedings twice a day from enrollment until 40 weeks PMA, discharge/transfer or death. Primary endpoint for the study will be BSI or NEC after 3 days of age while receiving study treatment.  Safety will be assessed throughout the study and post discharge parent surveys of infant feeding type (human milk, formula type, and cow's milk) during the first two years.  Lactoferrin levels will be measured in saliva, scavenged blood samples, and in maternal or donor breast milk when on full enteral feeding volumes for one week around week 3-4.       The sample size is based on a two-sided type I error rate of 0.05 and 80 percent power, using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, to detect an absolute difference of 50 percent in the cumulative incidence of BSI or NEC between groups based on 2016 Vermont Oxford Network (VON) data on incidence of late-onset infections of 23% and NEC of 10%.      Aim 2.  To examine the effects of lactoferrin on postnatal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) acquisition. Fresh human milk is the preferred diet for this preterm population, but carries the risk of postnatal CMV acquisition. Saliva samples will be performed prior to and at the end of study solution administration.  Postnatal CMV acquisition will be determined by detection of CMV in saliva by qPCR using a previously established dried saliva swab qPCR method and then compared between lactoferrin and placebo groups    Aim 3.  To investigate the effects of lactoferrin on growth and development. Growth during study solution administration and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age will be assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II).  VABS-II is a skill-based measure that is well validated in preterm infants and has been used in other neonatal multicenter trails.  It can be performed in person or by phone facilitating and increasing the number of patients we obtain long term follow up. This is critical as many patients may be outborn or live close to their NICU's institution.       Aim 4.  To examine the effects of lactoferrin on the stool microbiome. The effects of lactoferrin on the stool microbiome is lacking and may play a role in its effectiveness.  Stool samples will be collected when infants are tolerating full enteral feedings (>120 ml/kg/day and off antibiotics for 7 days), and will be compared between groups for diversity and dysbiosis using standard 16s rRNA sequencing.        Primary endpoint for the study will be BSI or NEC (Stage 2 or greater)  after 3 days of age while receiving study treatment.

Community outreach will include public flyers and distribution emails to research networks.    We chose to exclude individuals with prevalent heart failure who may be prescribed oral nitrates, which are contraindicated with PDE5 inhibitors. We do not plan to exclude individuals who are prescribed PDE5 inhibitors as needed for erectile dysfunction.

Medical therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and treatment of diabetes have evolved since the HOPE trial was conducted, which may require reconsideration of the assumed event rates.      We would be eager to work with the TIC to arrive at other event rate assumptions based on contemporary medical therapy for the target population. We would also be interested in working with the TIC on innovative trial designs to optimize statistical power and feasibility.    Sample Size and Power Calculation  Using the primary endpoint event rates (14.0% in the ramipril group and 17.8% in the placebo group after 5 years of follow-up) reported in the HOPE study, we calculated the hazard rate as 0.030 and 0.039 (HR of 0.769) in the ramipril and the placebo groups, respectively.  The common exponential drop-out rate was estimated as 0.074. When the sample size in each group is 2827, with a total number of events required of 522, an exponential maximum likelihood test of equality of survival curves with a 0.05 two-sided significance level will have 85% power to detect the difference between the hazard rates of 0.030 and 0.039, (a hazard ratio of 0.769); this assumes an accrual period of 2.5 years and a maximum follow-up time of 4.5 years. We plan to enroll a total of 5800, with 2900 subjects in each group.    Data Analysis Plan  For the primary endpoint and other secondary time-to-event endpoints, we will calculate the rate as the ratio of the total number of incident cases and the total number of person-years of follow-up for each treatment group. The standard error of the rate estimate will be obtained using the standard maximum likelihood method. Then the between-group incident rate ratio can be estimated along with the 95% confidence interval (CI) using the delta method. If the CI excludes one, we will conclude the incident rates are significantly different. For these time-to-event endpoints, Kaplan Meier survival or event curves will be constructed for each treatment group and the between-group comparison will be made using the log-rank test. If necessary, the COX proportional hazards model will be used to adjust for imbalanced covariates or key risk factors for the event when estimating the hazard ratio between the PDE5 inhibitor and placebo groups. We will test all hypotheses at the level of ?=0.05.     For all endpoints, the primary analysis will be intention-to-treat: all subjects randomized with a post-treatment endpoint assessment will be included. Any subject who is identified as a major protocol violator will not be included. Major protocol violators will be defined based on criteria that will be finalized by the study team and approved by the DSMB prior to unblinding. The list would include subjects randomized to PDE5 inhibition with undetectable drug concentrations on multiple study days, for example.	\N	\N	\N	\N	6	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	39	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	We anticipate that subjects will be enrolled primarily from Internal Medicine, Cardiology, and Endocrinology outpatient clinics.  Accordingly, we will select high-volume academic and community sites with broad research infrastructure and a track record of successful trial enrollment.  We welcome assistance from the TIC to identify such sites.    We will also engage in alternative recruitment strategies based on input from the Recruitment Innovation Center. Alternative strategies may include identification of subjects using methods to parse electronic medical records, social media, and community engagement meetings, among other approaches.    We expect an enrollment period of at least 2.5 years, though this would depend on enrollment rate and the observed event rate, depending on the study design. Follow-up will occur at months 1 and 6 and then yearly thereafter until study completion.  Subjects will be asked about side effects, adverse events, and medication compliance during study visits. To further improve compliance, we may consider automated emails and/or text messages to confirm adherence to study drug.	The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that chronic inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) will reduce cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal events in high-risk individuals.    Aim 1 is to examine the effect of chronic PDE5 inhibition on cardiovascular outcomes in high risk individuals.  Aim 2 is to examine the effect of PDE5 inhibition on a composite of cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal outcomes in high risk individuals.   Aim 3 is to examine physiological endpoints at selected sites:  plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), albumin/creatinine ration, flow mediated dilation	\N	\N	\N	Intervention: tadalafil 20mg or placebo by mouth, daily    We have chosen tadalafil over a potential alternative, sildenafil (TID dosing), due to proven safety in our pilot study and once daily dosing, which will improve compliance and maximize the likelihood of detecting an effect. The patent for tadalafil will expire in November 2017, after which time cost is expected to fall. Based on experience with other medications, we expect generic tadalafil to be 80% less expensive than branded tadalafil, which will make it cost-effective for the proposed trial. We have received an IND exemption from the FDA to use tadalafil for our prior studies; we are preparing an exemption application for this study and do not anticipate any obstacles to proceeding.    Tadalafil 20mg tablets will be supplied by the Vanderbilt Investigational Drug Service (IDS) or local, which will supply study drug and placebo to each site. The IDS will compound placebo tablets that are indistinguishable from tadalafil in appearance, smell, and taste. After a subject completes the screening and consent process a unique study ID will be assigned to him/her and the pharmacist will log into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) program to find the randomization group for this subject. Permuted block randomization stratified by gender and race (white and African-American) will be used to ensure approximate balance of treatment groups within each stratum over time. Separate randomization schemes are generated for each gender and race prior to study initiation by a biostatistician and schemes will be uploaded to a REDCap database. This randomization will be performed in small blocks, which vary in size. Investigators will be unaware of the size or order of the blocks.	1	37	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	49	200	\N	1	\N	Primary Aim 1: To examine the effect of chronic PDE5 inhibition on cardiovascular outcomes in high risk individuals.

Each cohort will be analyzed separately to assess the feasibility of conducting pre-operative SLN mapping using real-time optical detection procedures and intradermal single- or double-dose injection/s of non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots about the primary tumor site. Feasibility will be determined on the basis of achieving adequate image contrast for detection, as defined by signal-to-background ratios, and whether optical signal distinguishes diseased SLNs from non-diseased ones (see Appendix 4). Our sample size is chosen based on ethical, logistical and financial limitations rather than statistical considerations and is consistent with other pilot studies in the literature. Expected length of accrual is about 1 year.    All Phase I aims will be addressed with descriptive analysis. For the primary aim optical signal will be summarized as a continuous variable separately within the diseased and non-diseased lymph nodes.  No statistical analysis is planned for secondary aim 1. Secondary aim 2 of correlating optical imaging findings of SLN/s, either within the nodal basin or as excised nodal specimens, with routine gamma counting will be addressed by empirical (Pearson) and rank correlation (Spearman) methods with both variables as continuous.     Phase 2-Melanoma  This study has two parts: in the first part 20 patients will be enrolled and imaged at a fixed optimized dose (5 nanomoles) and volume (up to 1 ml) of fluorescent cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots will be locally administered about the primary tumor site, while varying the timing interval between the injection and visualization of fluorescence signal in optically-active nodes, in order to maximize detection of metastases. Fixed optimized dose, volume, and timing interval from these studies will then be applied to another 40 enrolled patients as part of this Phase 2 trial to assess efficacy.    In the second part we will use the excised lymph nodes from 40 patients to assess concordance of optical signal with gamma counts with histological confirmation. We will estimate the ROC curve for the optical signal and report estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive and predictive values at the cutpoint corresponding to the Youden index. We will conservatively estimate that we will have 40 excised lymph nodes and we will consider the study a success if 80% (32) of the 40 lymph nodes have concordance between optical signal and pathology. This decision rule has 4% probability of declaring the study successful if the true concordance is 70%.This probability increases to 95% if the true concordance rate os 90%.     Proportion of lymph nodes identified by 99mTc sulfur colloid that are positive by cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dot visualization will be computed as a binomial parameter along with 95% exact confidence intervals. All adverse events will be monitored and reported.     As a secondary aim, detection rates of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots and Tc99m sulfur colloid for pathology-positive SLNs will be estimated again using a binomial proportion and an exact confidence interval. We will assess integrin expression levels in primary and nodal tissue specimens derived from a subset of patients.	Weill Cornell Medicine  MSKCC  NYU   Mt.

Pre-operative standard-of-care SPECT/CT imaging findings of the primary melanoma and draining lymph node basin will be used to optimize patient positioning in the operative suite prior to conducting fluorescence imaging and surgical excision of the primary lesion and SLN/s. An intraoperative, hand-held multichannel fluorescence camera system will acquire two-dimensional large field-of-view NIR images in the context of adjacent soft tissue structures for assessing the full extent of nodal disease within the nodal basin. The camera system will be optimized for real-time, detection of Cy5.5 optical signal during SLN mapping procedures in humans. Confirmation of fluorescence signal from tumor and nodes within the surgically exposed nodal basin will be based on measurements of low-energy gamma emissions from 99mTc-sulfur colloid using routine gamma probes. These probes will be used to determine counts at the tumor site, identify SLN/s and suspected metastatic nodes, as well as assay background tissues.     Non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots will be injected intradermally in 4-quadrants about the tumor site into intact skin, following by high resolution optical scanning in video mode (>15 frames per second) to map dynamic changes in particle transit from the injection site into the draining lymphatics and nodes with successive surgical exposure. The maximum total dose injected will be 12 nanomoles, which corresponds to 100 times the NOAEL determined in mice, on a nanomol/gr basis. We have previously safely administered up to 11 nanomoles of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots in about 14 patients, escalating the dose to optimize detection. Furthermore, in colorectal cancer patients, we will administer the particle prior to or after the standard of care agent ICG in order to improve overall flow to the sentinel node. Up to 5 ml injectable volumes (in 0.9% NaCl) will be used to achieve a final total dose that falls within this pre-set range of doses (i.e., 5.6 - 24 nanomoles.) Intradermal injections into the extremity will utilize dose ranges similar to melanoma and breast cancer (i.e., 5.6 - 12 nanomoles) and up to 1 ml injectable volumes.	\N	\N	24	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	This study is being sponsored by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

The lights in the operating room will be turned off, and the surgical field will be illuminated (irradiance < 10 mW/cm2; limit for skin 200 mW/cm2) to assess fluorescence signal in the SLN. Camera exposure times will be less than 80 ms. The standard surgical procedure, including sentinel node biopsy, will otherwise be performed.	1	391	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	4	\N	\N	\N	Phase 1- Breast and Colorectal Malignancies  The objective of this first in human SLN mapping study is to assess the feasibility of utilizing optical imaging technologies− FDA, IND-approved non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots coupled with a state-of-the-art, portable fluorescent camera system- for SLN detection in the intraoperative setting. Detected optical signal will be confirmed with measured radioactive emissions in breast patients using standard of care approaches. Feasibility will be investigated in the primary aim and first secondary aim.    Primary Aim: Assess whether locally injected non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots injected about the primary tumor site or within the  mucosa (for colorectal cases) or, can identify fluorescent  nodes within the nodal basin of colorectal malignancies and breast cancer patients intraoperatively, as determined by pathological examination.     Given the exploratory nature of this trial, the following secondary aims are proposed to address several study unknowns that relate to minimum particle dosing and the achievement of adequate optical signal in SLNs.     Secondary Aim 1: Determine whether a NIR fluorescence signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 1.1 or greater optimizes image contrast and enables identification of diseased nodes, along with the smallest dose of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots needed to achieve this threshold ratio.     Secondary Aim 2: Correlate optical imaging findings of in situ and excised nodal specimens, in terms of intensity, with routine gamma counting.     Phase 2-Melanoma   The objective of this Phase 2 SLN mapping study is to assess the ongoing safety and efficacy and efficacy of  detecting nodal metastases utilizing a combination of intraoperative FDA, IND-approved non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots, fluorescent camera system.. Detected optical signal will continue to be confirmed by measured radioactive emissions from standard-of-care 99mTc sulfur colloid in melanoma patients.  Efficacy and safety endpoints will be investigated in the primary aims and first secondary aim. We will continue to monitor for any adverse events following injection of the non-radioactive particle probe. Following locally-injected, non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots about the primary tumor site and using a handheld NIR fluorescence camera system, fluorescent SLN/s within the nodal basin will be identified and assessed for metastases, with pathological correlation, as follows:    Primary Aims:   1.\tAssess concordance of optical signal with gamma counts in excised lymph nodes after administration of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dot and Tc-99m sulfur colloid, respectively, on the basis of histologic confirmation.   2.\tDetermine the proportion of lymph nodes identified by 99mTc sulfur colloid that are positive by cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dot visualization  3.\tMonitor for adverse reactions to the non-radioactive particle probe as a safety endpoint.      Secondary Aims:   1.\tCompare detection rates of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots and Tc99m sulfur collide for pathology-positive SLNs.  2.\tAssess 3 integrin expression levels in primary and nodal tissue specimens derived from a subset of patients	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	90	\N	\N

The duration will depend on the frequency of endpoints that we identify in Part 2.	Although the specifics are TBD, based on info gathered in Parts I and II, we anticipate that the study subjects will be all adult patients with appointments to attend designated primary care clinics in sites selected to participate in the trial.  Inclusion of children would be difficult because of the need for parents to have care seats that would have to be installed for each shared ride, and then carried around with them during clinic visits.	173	We will select institutions that currently use Uber Health and are willing to expand Uber Health to clinics within their system.  Patients visiting clinics with newly-initiated Uber Health services will be compared with patients attending clinics that do not currently use Uber Health and are not planning to initiate use during the 3-4 months of the study.  The challenge will be to ensure that clinics in the treatment and control arms have comparable endpoints at the start of the study.  The specific criteria for offers of Uber Health rides, e.g. missed 2+ visits in prior year, will be determined from the key informant interviews in Part 1 and the review of historical data in Part 2.	\N	Part I:  Identification of possible use cases for an efficacy trial.

This study will be open to U.S. health care institutions that currently offer Uber Health rides and are willing to expand use for the study.

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial will be conducted to assesses whether statin therapy based on a GRS for ASCVD is associated with a reduction in adverse events in patients at intermediate risk (5-7.5% over 10 years). We will leverage the infrastructure created as a part of an earlier pilot study including a CLIA-certified genotyping process, a genomic decision aid to disclose cardiovascular risk, integration of genomic information within the electronic health record, and the CCATS infrastructure for clinical trials.{Brown, 2017 #44890}   Eligibility criteria will include: men and women ≥50 years of age without a history of cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol level <190 mg/dL and an intermediate risk of ASCVD (5-7.5% 10-y risk). All potentially eligible subjects will undergo a 4-week run-in phase during which they receive placebo to identify a group of willing and eligible participants who demonstrate good compliance (defined as the taking of more than 80% of all study tablets) during that interval. Only subjects who successfully complete the run-in phase will be enrolled.	100	Eligibility criteria will include: men and women ≥50 years of age without a history of cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol level <190 mg/dL and an intermediate risk of ASCVD (5-7.5% 10-y risk), willingness to participate for the duration of the trial, and a triglyceride level <500 mg per deciliter. Exclusion criteria will include previous or current use of lipid-lowering therapy, evidence of hepatic dysfunction (an alanine aminotransferase level >twice the upper limit of the normal range), a creatine kinase level >more than three times the upper limit of the normal range, a creatinine level >2.0 mg per deciliter, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure >190 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >100 mm Hg), cancer within 5 years before enrollment (with the exception of basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin), and a recent history of alcohol or drug abuse or another medical condition that might compromise safety or the successful completion of the study.	\N	The primary outcome will be the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event, defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, an arterial revascularization procedure, or confirmed death from cardiovascular causes. Secondary end points will include the components of the primary end point considered individually - arterial revascularization or hospitalization for unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes - and death from any cause.    All reported primary end points will be adjudicated on the basis of standardized criteria by an independent end-point committee unaware of the randomized treatment assignments. Only deaths classified as clearly due to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular causes by the end-point committee will be included in the analysis of the primary end point. For the end point of death from any cause, all deaths will be included, regardless of whether data were available to confirm the cause of death.     All primary analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis. Event rates for the rosuvastatin and placebo groups will be compared using the proportional-hazards regression model to adjust for variable length of follow-up.

Eligibility criteria will include: men and women ≥50 years of age without a history of cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol level <190 mg/dL and an intermediate risk of ASCVD (5-7.5% 10-y risk), willingness to participate for the duration of the trial, and a triglyceride level <500 mg per deciliter.

Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rosuvastatin, 20 mg daily, or matching placebo. Randomization will be performed with the use of an interactive voice-response system and stratified according to center and family history of CHD. Follow-up visits will be scheduled to occur at 13 weeks and then 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 months after randomization. A closeout visit will occur after study termination. Follow-up assessments will include laboratory evaluations, pill counts, and structured interviews assessing outcomes and potential adverse events. Measurements of lipid levels, hepatic and renal function, blood glucose levels, and glycated hemoglobin values will be performed in a central laboratory. Personnel at each site will also contact their participants midway between scheduled visits to evaluate their well-being and to maintain study participation.	\N	\N	301	\N	\N	220	\N	\N	Individuals at primary care visits, who are at intermediate risk (5-7.5% 10 year risk by PCE), will be genotyped to calculate the genetic risk score. The PCE will be multiplied by the GRS to estimate a composite risk based on their genetic and conventional risks. One would then identify a cohort that exceeds the current treatment threshold of 7.5% 10-y risk. If we assume that in the group screened, the average conventional 10-year risk is the average of 5% and 7.5%, i.e. 6.25%, and the risk is uniformly distributed between 5 and 7.5% and the distribution of GRS is similar to that in our MIGENES study, we can multiply the risk ratio factor in that dataset by the CRS risk to obtain the composite risk.      Given these assumptions, we can obtain the distribution of composite risk, and in particular we can identify what proportion has a risk >7.5%. We estimated 23% of those with an average risk will have a composite risk >7.5% to 8.95% (9%). Thus, we will identify a cohort with composite risk >7.5% (23%) whose average risk is 9%. To determine sample size necessary to detect a 30% reduction from the baseline risk, we assume a 5 year trial, and assume that the risks are ½ of the 10-year risks. Therefore the 5-year risks (without statins) will be either ½ of 9% (4.5%). The number of patients required is a function of the baseline rate. For a baseline rate of 4.5%, and for a 30% reduction, the required number of patients is 6628. With a screening ratio of 23%, this translates to either 6628 / 0.23 = 28,817 screened.	\N	\N	\N	Australia, UK, Ireland, Spain, Germany	5	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	14	No conflicts.	t	\N	\N	f	We would recruit participants from primary care and cardiology clinics across the US and additional countries.

Dr. Kullo is proposing a randomized clinical trial using genetic risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), to initiate statin therapy in individuals at intermediate risk. The goal of the proposed trial is to investigate whether statin therapy in participants with increased genetic risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), reduces adverse cardiovascular events in patients at intermediate 10-y of ASCVD risk (5-7.5%).	\N	\N	\N	A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial will be conducted to assesses whether statin therapy based on a GRS for ASCVD is associated with a reduction in adverse events in patients at intermediate risk (5-7.5% over 10 years). Individuals (n=6628) without known ASCVD, with a 10-y risk of ASCVD of 5-7.5% and who are reclassified as having >7.5% risk based on their GRS, will be randomly allocated to a statin (rosuvastatin 20 mg) daily vs placebo. The 10-y ASCVD risk will be estimated based on pooled cohort equations (PCE) provided in the ACC/AHA guidelines. A GRS for ASCVD will be calculated from genotypes at ~100 susceptibility loci for CHD and ischemic stroke as previously described.	1	246	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	19	30	\N	2	\N	A major impediment to reducing the morbidity and mortality from CHD is the suboptimal performance of existing CHD risk calculators which do not incorporate family history or genetic factors. Up to 50% of CHD may be heritable with polygenic or oligogenic and/or monogenic factors contributing to disease predisposition. We have previously shown that incorporating a GRS leads to significant reclassification of CHD risk in individuals at 'intermediate' risk{Ding, 2011 #44759} and others have shown that a GRS for CHD is predictive of incident adverse events and response to statins.{Mega, 2015 #51} Genetic profiling is a promising means of improving the precision of risk estimates for individual patients. Studies by Mega et al.{Mega, 2015 #43819} and Khera et al.{Khera, 2016 #44853} demonstrate that individuals in the highest quintile of a polygenic risk score for CHD are at 77-90% higher risk for adverse events.   Accordingly we propose a randomized clinical trial of using genetic risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of mortality in the Western world, to initiate statin therapy in individuals at intermediate risk.     The objective of the proposed trial is to investigate whether statin therapy in participants with increased genetic risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), reduces adverse cardiovascular events in patients at intermediate 10-y of ASCVD risk (5-7.5%). We hypothesize that in patients whose 10-y ASCVD risk after incorporating a GRS for ASCVD exceeds 7.5%, those randomized to statin therapy will have lower rate of adverse CV outcomes.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	20	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	6700	\N	\N

After completion of the dose escalation, an expansion phase will be conducted separately in ALL and AML to further assess the safety, feasibility and biological activity of this therapy. Pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies to evaluate target inhibition will be performed. Remission rates and measurements of minimal residual disease will be determined at the end of the first treatment cycle and responding patients can receive 2 cycles of therapy.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	This will be a phase I trial conducted through the HICCP network, a partnership between the Huntsman Cancer Institute and Intermountain Healthcare, and NYU Langone Medical Center.  A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used and the DLT observation period will be the first cycle of therapy. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4.0.     The first 3 patients enrolled will be evaluated to determine the number of patients demonstrating a WBC count increase above 100,000/µL, or symptoms attributable to rapid disease progression during SP-2577 monotherapy from days 1 through 7. Conventional salvage treatment will be initiated if disease progresses rapidly. If 2 or more patients in either disease cohort demonstrate rapid WBC rise, enrollment will be temporarily suspended and consideration given to amending the study to exclude the single-agent SP-2577 pre-phase for future enrollments.    The recommended Phase 2 dose for SP-2577 + chemotherapy is the dose at which no more than one of 6 evaluable patients has had a DLT and target inhibition is achieved during the study prephase. A total of up to 6 additional patients with ALL and AML will be treated at the recommended phase 2 dose for SP-2577 + chemotherapy to assess the toxicity and tolerability at that dose.    DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are at least (possibly, probably or definitely) attributable to SP-2577. Non-hematological DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or greater non-hematological toxicity attributable to the investigational drug with the specific exclusion of: Grade 3 nausea and vomiting, Grade 3 or 4 fever or infection, Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities that are transient (<24 hours) and not associated with clinical sequelae  and alopecia.  Hematological DLT will be defined as the absence of peripheral blood count recovery (ANC > 500/μL and platelet count > 20,000/μL) within 6 weeks of starting systemic chemotherapy (protocol Day 8) in those patients who achieve remission as documented by marrow aplasia, not marrow infiltration.    A patient enrolled on the trial who receives any prescribed therapy is considered evaluable for toxicity. A patient is evaluable for DLT if they terminate protocol therapy due to toxicity, or if they receive at least 85% of protocol prescribed therapy during cycle 1 without experiencing DLT. A patient enrolled on the trial who receives any prescribed therapy is considered evaluable for response.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	SP-2577 was developed at the University of Utah.	\N	\N	\N	\N	We anticipate enrollment of 3-4 patients annually through the HICCP network and 1-2 patients annually at NYU Langone Medical Center.  If safety and tolerability are established in an initial cohort of patients, we will expand enrollment to younger and older patients. Upon favorable early assessment of SP-2577 locally, we also envision an opportunity for study expansion to other centers, whereby accruals are expected to rise to 1-2 pediatric patients per month. We anticipate accrual of a maximum of 30 patients over 36 months. This estimate is based on the number of potentially eligible patients we see in each of the practices.  Given the relative rarity of the patient population, recruitment efforts are important for meeting accrual goals.	\N	\N	\N	\N	This phase 1 study will determine the tolerability and biological activity of SP-2577 in patients 12-30 years old with second or greater relapse of ALL or AML, or refractory disease. Currently, the only available formulation of SP-2577 is 75 mg capsules, limiting the lower age inclusion range. During the first cycle, ALL patients will receive SP-2577 monotherapy at a dose of 75 mg PO TID on days 1-7. Cyclophosphamide and etoposide will be added on days 8-12 and SP-2577 will be continued on days 13-28. AML patients will be treated similarly, but instead will receive 5-azacytidine on days 8-12. If this dose of SP-2577 is found to be intolerable, a subsequent cohort will be enrolled at the de-escalated dose of 75 mg PO BID. If the starting dose of SP-2577 is tolerable, two additional dose levels will be investigated:  150 mg PO TID and 225 mg PO TID.     We envision refinement of the dose escalation schema based on the results of a phase 1 trial in Ewing sarcoma in children that is anticipated to open in the second quarter of 2018. The dose escalation phase of the trial will include both ALL and AML patients.  Following the dose confirmation phase, expanded cohorts of 6 ALL and 6 AML patients will be enrolled to further assess the safety, feasibility and biological activity of this therapy. Pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies to evaluate target inhibition will also be performed. The activity of this combination will be preliminarily evaluated by assessing marrow disease status and peripheral blast clearance on day 8 and rates of remission and measurements of minimal residual disease (MRD) on day 29 of the combination regimen.	2	254	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	Primary Objectives:  1.

\N	\N	6	\N	\N	\N	Not provided	The study population will be all ED patients ages 6 months to <18 years with clinician concern for septic shock, as operationalized below in Section 11 'Entry Criteria'.    Potential recruitment challenges include:    a)    Need for enrollment of a high proportion of eligible patients to reduce selection bias and meet sample size requirements.    Proposed solutions are to ensure equipoise of participating ED clinicians through education of study rationale, design, and endpoints and establishing enrollment practices that can be easily embedded within normal clinical workflow. Notably, an advantage of using PECARN is their demonstrable success with enrollment into prior clinical trials.(34-36)    b)   Need to exclude patients who require minimal fluid resuscitation for mild dehydration, which represents most fluid bolus administrations in the pediatric ED.    Proposed solution is to limit enrollment to patients that the clinician judges will require additional fluid beyond an initial 20 mL/kg bolus to treat poor perfusion defined as either hypotension or abnormal capillary refill.(37)    c)    Need to begin study procedures within a very narrow therapeutic window of minutes from presentation while maintaining compliance with ethical human subjects' regulations.    Proposed solution is to seek Federal 'exception from informed consent' (EFIC) due to the life-threatening nature of septic shock and the narrow therapeutic window for fluid resuscitation (on the order of minutes after presentation).  PECARN has prior experience with EFIC in a pediatric clinical trial,(35) and the CHOP IRB (personal communication, Barbara Engel MD, PhD and Mark Schreiner, MD) has agreed that this study proposal meets the ethical standards and requirement to utilize EFIC. An appropriate plan for community consultation and public disclosure will be established under the guidance of Jill Baren, MD, chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at University of Pennsylvania, who has experience coordinating EFIC for a prior pediatric trial through PECARN.(35)	35	Entry criteria will be ED patients >6 months and <18 years with clinician concern for septic shock.  Septic shock will be operationalized as 1) an order for parenteral antibiotics for suspected infection, 2) administration of at least 20 mL/kg IV/intraosseous (IO) fluid, and 3) additional fluid planned to treat poor perfusion defined as either hypotension or abnormal capillary refill (per clinician's judgment).  These criteria are adapted from the SCCM/ACCM pediatric septic shock guidelines and commonly used pediatric sepsis trigger tools for the early recognition of septic shock in the pediatric ED setting.(3,5,37)  Only patients expected to receive at least 10 ml/kg of additional bolus fluid will be randomized to receive study fluid for subsequent boluses.  Patients receiving >40 mL/kg IV/IO fluid prior to randomization will be excluded.    We are also contemplating including a plan for enrichment of patient enrollment through Bayesian monitoring of pre-specified sub-groups that may demonstrate a higher probability of differential outcome related to LR versus.  Potential sub-groups that may be selectively enriched include patients less than five years of age and patients with cancer or other immunosuppressive comorbid conditions.	\N	The primary efficacy outcome will be all-cause hospital mortality, censored at 90 days from study enrollment.  Mortality remains an important patient-centered outcome and, in this pragmatic trial, is objective, clinically-meaningful, easily measured, and generalizable.(31)  Moreover, because all-cause hospital mortality is objective, bias imposed by lack of blinding will be minimized.  Alternative primary endpoints, including organ dysfunction-related morbidity, are surrogates for mortality and changes in organ dysfunction in pediatric sepsis have not been clearly linked to changes in mortality.(39)  Organ dysfunction is also substantially more complicated to measure than mortality.  Vasoactive-free days was considered, but prolonged use of vasoactive infusions is rarely necessary in pediatrics, even in children who die.  Hospital-free days was also considered as a primary outcome, but as this composite endpoint includes length of stay, it is more susceptible to factors beyond septic shock itself (e.g., comorbid conditions, social concerns, local practice patterns).  Although much of the potential benefits of LR may be mediated through reduced hyperchloremic acute kidney toxicity, direct assessment of biochemical endpoints or acute kidney injury is less demonstrative of comparative effectiveness if these intermediary outcomes do not translate into more tangible benefits.  Finally, post-hospital outcomes, such as quality of life, are prohibitively expensive to measure with high-quality in such a large cohort of study patients.

As shown in Figure 1 (in attachment), eligible patients will be identified as part of clinical practice and, if the treating clinician believes that additional fluid is indicated for abnormal perfusion, then patients will be enrolled and randomized to receive either LR or NS open-label fluid for all further bolus and maintenance fluid until 11:59 pm of the next calendar day.  Closing the study window at 11:59 pm will ensure that all patients receive at least 24 hours of study fluid, which is the time from presentation in which most fluid resuscitation is completed for septic shock.(27)  The volume and need for additional fluid, as well as all other aspects of care, will be at the discretion of the treating team.  After the study window, all care including type of fluid will be at the discretion of the treating team.  The study team will assess patients at hospital discharge (or 90 days from study enrollment, whichever comes first) for vital status (primary outcome, Aim 1), days alive and out-of-hospital by day 28 ('hospital-free days'), time interval from ED presentation to hospital death, use of renal replacement therapy, hospital LOS, and 90-day mortality (secondary outcomes, Aim 1), and will review the medical record for pre-specified adverse outcomes (safety outcomes, Aim 2).    Data collection will be brief and objective (consistent with the tenets of a pragmatic trial (31)) and will include date of ED visit, volume of study and non-study fluids and blood products, age, race, weight, key comorbid conditions, non-study therapies, infectious site/source/microbiology, ED disposition, and data needed to determine outcomes.  Data will be collected locally through a web-based case report form overseen by the data coordinating center (DCC).  Sufficient data will be collected to ensure balanced randomization.    Selection bias will be reduced by regular audits of ED patients to identify eligible patients not enrolled. We will provide targeted education if <95% of eligible patients are enrolled/randomized over one month.  If <80% of eligible patients are enrolled/randomized over two consecutive months, the site will be placed on monitored probation with removal of the site if enrollment/randomization does not increase to >80% within two additional months.  Selection bias will be further reduced by using individual-level randomization to minimize potential for selective enrollment if allocation concealment was broken prior to study enrollment.    Misclassification bias due to assignment cross-over will be monitored by study personnel to ensure that at least 75% of fluid received in the study window is the randomly assigned study fluid.  If <80% of study patients meet this minimum criteria over one month, targeted education to treating clinicians will be provided.  If <70% of eligible patients meet this criteria over two consecutive months, the site will be placed on monitored probation with removal of the site if >75% compliance with study fluid administration is not achieved within two additional months.	\N	\N	676	\N	\N	85	\N	\N	A Mantel-Haenszel statistic, assessing the effect of intervention on all-cause hospital mortality controlling for strata (age, sex, and site), will be calculated to test the hypothesis of no difference.  It is expected that, for both the final analyses as well as interim analyses, the asymptotic version of the Mantel-Haenszel test will be appropriate.  In the case of low outcome counts, a stratified exact score test will be carried out. Specifically, a logistic model will be fit where treatment factor level predicts primary outcome, conditional on stratum, and an exact significance test will be used.  Dichotomous secondary and safety outcomes will be analyzed in the same manner, while continuous outcomes will be analyzed using a Van Elteren test, stratified by the same factors.    Pre-specified subgroup analyses will be performed for the following factors: a) admission to an ICU, b) cancer, and c) abnormal kidney function at presentation. A subgroup effect will be declared significant in a logistic or linear model testing for each particular interaction. Adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons. We will also conduct a post-hoc analysis for patients receiving different amounts of resuscitation crystalloid fluids (<100 ml/kg vs 100-200 ml/kg vs >200) using multivariable regression to account for unbalanced covariates given this analysis will be stratified based on post-randomization characteristics.	\N	\N	\N	\N	14	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	122	None of the primary investigators, co-investigators, or PECARN site leaders have any financial interests or potential conflicts that might be related to the proposal.	\N	\N	\N	f	Based on local epidemiologic data from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and published national estimates,(40) we expect 190 and 289 children to be eligible per 100,000 annual ED visits.  Since the EDs in PECARN sees 1.1 million visits across its 18 sites per year, we anticipate enrollment of ~2,000 patients/year over 4 years if at least 70% of eligible patients are enrolled.  If additional sites can be recruited through the Trial Innovation Network, subject accrual can be reduced to 3-4 years which will reduce enrollment fatigue at sites and yield faster trial results.  Final data collection, cleaning, analysis, and manuscript preparation will require 1-2 years.  NIH grant submission is targeted for June 2017.	Dr. Scott Weiss and Dr. Fran Balamuth from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) consulted with members of the Utah Trial Innovation Center (TIC) on February 10, 2017 and February 28, 2017 to undergo the initial consultation for the Pragmatic Pediatric Trial of Balanced versus Normal Saline Fluid in Sepsis (PRoMPT BOLUS) study. Dr. Weiss is a pediatric intensive care physician and Dr. Balamuth is a pediatric emergency department physician. The goal of the consultation was for Dr. Weiss to receive feedback and recommendations in specific areas of his study and to better position the study for a comprehensive consultation. The first meeting was a 90-minute webinar during which Drs. Weiss and Balamuth presented the study background and proposal concept.    The second meeting was in-person in Salt Lake City with Drs. Weiss and Balamuth in attendance. Co-Investigators Dr. Nate Kupperman (UC Davis) and Dr. Jill Baren (University of Pennsylvania) called in via teleconference. Michelle Culp was the NCATS project scientist on the teleconference.  Dr. J. Michael Dean, PI of the Utah TIC, began with attendee introductions and a brief overview of the TIC and Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) networks.     The PECARN network is a federally (HRSA MCHB EMSC program) funded multi-site network that conducts research on prevention and management of acute illnesses and injuries in children. The network is highly efficient at patient enrollment, for example enrolling 43,000 head injury patients in 18 months.  There are currently six "nodes" that each have three sites, and a data coordinating center (DCC).  Dr. Dean is the PI of this DCC, as noted in the Utah TIC proposal narrative, his biosketch, and the Other Support materials submitted to NCATS.  Each clinical site has a research coordinator, and the DCC has a core budget, but the PECARN network does not have dedicated protocol funds.  For this reason, all trials must be submitted to NIH or other sources (such as PCORI) as grants.  The network has been very successful, having submitted nearly $100 million of successful grant proposals in the last decade.  There is no overlap between the funding provided to the DCC from HRSA and potential support from the TIC because the PECARN DCC will not be providing services for this project.	\N	\N	\N	The intervention to be tested is fluid resuscitation with LR compared to the 'usual practice' control fluid of NS.     The proposed interventional plan is that, following an initial 20 mL/kg bolus, eligible patients will be randomized to receive either NS or LR for all remaining fluid administration (bolus and maintenance) for up to 48 hours.  For clarity, the study period will end at 11:59 pm on the calendar day following randomization such that all patients receive at least 24 hours of study fluid, which is the time-window from presentation in which most fluid resuscitation is completed for septic shock.(27)  Selective fluid administration has been previously shown to result in widely different amounts of saline use.(38)  Randomization will be performed using 1:1 permuted blocks stratified by age, sex, and site using a web- or PDA-based application.  Study fluids will not be blinded due to costs and interventions that are not in keeping with a simple, pragmatic trial and based on results from the previously published SPLIT fluid trial in which two-thirds of clinicians correctly identified the randomized crystalloid patients received (despite blinding) as electrolyte differences following NS or LR provide clear indication of fluid selection.(16)  All other care will be at the discretion of the clinical team.  As study fluids will not be blinded, patient-level randomization will minimize selection bias due to awareness of group assignment.  Study fluids can be stopped for clinician concerns noted during routine care (e.g., hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, cerebral edema).  Adherence to the study intervention will be monitored remotely through random chart audits and, if need, selected site visits.	2	32	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	140	18	\N	1	\N	Aim 1:  To test the hypothesis that fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's will reduce hospital mortality compared to fluid resuscitation with 0.9% normal saline in pediatric septic shock.    The primary efficacy outcome will be all-cause hospital mortality. Secondary efficacy outcomes will be days alive and out-of-hospital by day 28 ('hospital-free days'), time interval from ED presentation to hospital death, use of renal replacement therapy, hospital LOS, and 90-day mortality.         Aim 2:  To monitor the safety of lactated Ringer's versus 0.9% normal saline in routine clinical practice.    The safety outcomes will be adverse events previously reported for either LR or NS, including peak blood chloride, lactate, potassium, calcium and minimum blood pH and sodium in study window, thromboembolism, and brain herniation.  Because of the pragmatic study design, safety outcomes will be assessed as they occur in the course of routine clinical practice rather than through a protocolized assessment.(31)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	16	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	8800	\N	\N

The primary purpose is to determine if early detection (< 12 hours after a normal fetal heart rate/rhythm) and early TREATMENT (the intervention) will restore sinus rhythm (NSR) by the time of the baby's birth.  While a placebo-controlled trial would strengthen the results, despite clinical equipoise, our collaborating centers find this approach unacceptable.   A sample size of 13 fetuses with 2° AVB ensures 80% power to detect whether expeditious treatment (INTERVENTION) increases the response rate (restoration of NSR) from 35-75%.

For the primary outcome, a sample size of 13 fetuses with 2' AVB ensures 80% power with alpha=2.5% to detect whether expeditious treatment increases the proportion from the historic control of 37.6% to 75% (i.e., 9 out of 13 fetuses regressing). For the secondary outcome a one-sided test of proportions will test the % of neonates who are pacemaker free at 3 months of age, p2, with a null hypothesis (H0) of p2>0.204 (estimate from a meta-analysis of previous studies). While the aim is not powered for the secondary outcome, there is approximately 80% power with alpha=2.5% to detect an alternative hypothesis (H1) of p2<0.080 (i.e., 0 or 1 fetus out of 13 needing a pacemaker).    Aim 2: Given the heterogeneity in current treatment practices and the lack of previous data to use in proposing a formal statistical hypothesis, this aim is exploratory and no power calculations are provided. To summarize the % of fetuses with an AV interval < 170 ms who are NSR at birth we will present the proportion of cases with a 95% confidence interval around the estimate from our study. Additionally, we will descriptively categorize the trajectory of all fetuses within this aim to describe the natural history of prolongation and summarize the proportion of cases which advance to 1' AVB, 2' AVB, or 3' AVB throughout the course of monitoring and up until birth.    Aim 3: Given that CAVB has never been observed to permanently regress, this aim is descriptive and no power calculations are provided. The proportion of cases identified as CAVB during monitoring and their trajectory will be provided, and if any cases are shown to permanently regress we will describe the trajectory with a detailed case study and history. Further, in this descriptive aim, the occurrence of any other anti-Ro disease which causes extra-nodal injury beyond the AV node will be summarized with counts and percentages of the overall study sample.	\N	\N	\N	Canada	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	16	No one has any disclosures.	\N	\N	\N	\N	16 sites are currently actively recruiting anti-Ro + mothers to undergo home Doppler and fetal echo surveillance.

Those sites will participate in the new study if it is funded: additional sites have been contacted regarding the current proposal and have agreed to participate based on funding.   I think it will take 4.5 years to enroll the planned number of subjects based on our previous enrollments and the addition of at least 9 new sites based on Dr. Buyon's reputation as the lead investigator for the neonatal lupus registry.

Overview:  An open label, multi-institutional, prospective, single arm interventional clinical trial. The primary purpose is to determine if early detection (< 12 hours after a normal fetal heart rate/rhythm) and early TREATMENT (the intervention) of fetal anti-ro mediated 2o AV block (AVB) will restore normal sinus rhythm (NSR) by the time of the baby's birth. A meta-analysis of previous studies estimates 37.6% of cases with treated 2° block regress. .A sample size of 13 fetuses with 2° AVB ensures 80% power to detect whether expeditious treatment increases the response rate to 75%. Enrollment is projected at 1000 at-risk pregnancies, anticipating at least 20 (2%)of fetuses will develop disease eligible for treatment.    Objectives:  •\tAim 1.  To determine whether treatment of 2° AVB detected < 12 hours will prevent progression to CAVB.  •\tAim 2.  To assess treatment and natural history of fetal AV nodal prolongation measured by echocardiography.  •\tAim 3.  To determine the incidence of 3° AV block at initial detection by Doppler or echo and summarize outcomes of extra-nodal anti-Ro cardiac disease.	\N	\N	\N	The study interventions for fetal 2nd degree AV block: 1.

It will be the first randomized trial of treatment in patients with MINOCA, who comprise 5-20% of patients with MI.     The primary objective of MINOCA-BAT is to determine whether oral ACEI/ARB or BB, alone or together, reduces the composite endpoint of all-cause death or hospitalization for MI, ischemic stroke or heart failure in patients with MINOCA and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) >=40% who have no clinical signs of heart failure.     Secondary objectives are to determine whether for patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, EF >=40%, and no clinical signs of heart failure, oral ACEI/ARB or BB, alone or together, reduces all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for recurrent MI, hospitalization for ischemic stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, hospitalization for unstable angina and/or hospitalization for atrial fibrillation.     There are three safety objectives. 1) To determine whether oral ACEI/ARB and/or BB in patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, EF >=40%, and no clinical signs of heart failure increases hospitalizations for second or third degree AV-block, hypotension, syncope or need for pacemaker. 2) To determine whether oral ACEI/ARB and/or BB in patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, EF >=40%, and no clinical signs of heart failure increases hospitalizations for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. 3) To determine whether oral ACEI/ARB and/or BB in patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, EF >=40%, and no clinical signs of heart failure increases hospitalization for acute kidney injury.    Randomization will take place within 1-30 days of diagnosis of MINOCA. Randomization before hospital discharge will be encouraged. Randomization will be 1:1:1:1, to a) ACEI/ARB and BB, b) ACEI/ARB alone, c) BB alone, or d) neither ACEI/ARB nor BB.     The total sample size will be 5,608. Of these subjects, 2,108 will be recruited in North America at approximately 205 sites, with funding by this proposal. The remaining 3,500 will be recruited in Sweden and Australia, already funded separately.

It will represent a shared project between the CTSI units at these institutions. Children will be included in this study but the risks of the procedures and dietary intervention are warranted based on the potential benefit, namely reduction in NS disease activity. Boys and girls will be included and there will be no restriction on race/ethnicity.    The target sample size for the open label clinical trial is 25 children. It is anticipated that 100 potential participants will need to be screened to identify the cohort of children with difficult-to-treat NS and an elevated plasma zonulin level. In order to achieve this recruitment goals, strategies will be need to be developed, with the assistance of the Treatment Innovation Network, to promote awareness of the trial among physicians and patients residing in the vicinity of the participating sites. It is anticipated that the relative safety of the GFD will encourage participation by patients and their health care providers.	38	Entry Criteria: 1. Age 9 months - 18 years    2. Steroid sensitive NS, namely that administration of steroids achieves complete remission of proteinuria    3. Difficult-to-manage NS, be defined as disease that cannot be controlled without incurring intolerable side effects from currently available immunosuppressive agents, namely corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, or rituximab. Patients with biopsy-proven MCD or FSGS will be eligible.                            4. Elevated plasma zonulin level namely above 34 ng/ml    A renal biopsy will not be required and patients with a biopsy diagnosis of MCD or FSGS will be eligible as long as they are steroid sensitive.	\N	Primary Endpoint: Change in disease activity - relapse rate and dosage of immunosuppressive medications in response to the gluten-free diet. A ?50% reduction in relapse rate and/or a reduction by ?1 drug in exposure to immunosuppressive medications in response to the GFD will be considered a significant clinical benefit in the management of children with difficult-to-treat NS.    Rationale for primary endpoint:  Determining the prevalence of elevated plasma zonulin levels in children with NS would provide key information before designing an initiating a trial of a gluten-free diet in childhood NS.

It will represent a shared project between the CTSI units at the seven participating institutions. The site investigators contributed to the recent case series of children with difficult-to-manage NS who improved in response to a GFD (18).    Patients will be identified at each site using the electronic health record or divisional databases. After providing consent, the NS disease activity - number of relapses in prior 12 months FRNS or SDNS status, current medications, and side effects of steroids and other immunosuppressive drugs - will be recorded.    The plasma zonulin levels will be analyzed in accord with previously published methods. They will be determined using a commercially available ELISA kit (Immundiagnostik AG, Stubenwald-Allee 8a, D-64625 Bensheim, Germany) in the NYU Core Laboratory under the direction of Debra Morrison PhD. Results will be considered abnormal if the plasma zonulin level is above 34 ng/ml.    Patients with an elevated circulating zonulin-level will have baseline laboratory testing done to assess kidney function and proteinuria. A complete physical examination will be done including measurement of height, weight, BMI, BP and In addition the following blood tests will be performed to exclude CD -- IgA level, tissue transglutaminase IgA, anti-gliadin IgA, and anti-gliadin IgG.    After consultation with a nutritionist, the families will be instructed to implement a strict GFD. Patients will be evaluated by a renal nutritionist and given instructions on how to implement a GFD. They will be seen after 2 weeks to verify adherence to the modified diet and willingness to remain on the diet for at least 6 months.    The patients with difficult-to-treat NS and high plasma zonulin levels will then be treated with the GFD for 6 months. Adherence to the diet will be reassessed by the nutritionist at 3 months during the Treatment Period. The disease activity during the 6-month Treatment Period will be compared to the 12-month period prior to enrollment.    There will be no additional cost to participants. The study team will be responsible for covering the costs of analysis of the plasma zonulin levels and other laboratory testing will be guided to current clinical practice guidelines.         The risks are primarily those of a GFD because overall clinical management (clinic visits, laboratory testing) will not be altered by participation in the study. The potential benefit is improved control of the NS. A  Data Monitoring Committee will be established to assess the safety of the GFD in this unique patient cohort.	\N	\N	660	\N	\N	137	\N	\N	Statistical Plan: The data in this pilot study will be analyzed and summary statistics will be tabulated.

Ultimate goal of this study is to have a registry with women of reproductive age with all types of disability. The proportion of US women of reproductive age who have physical, intellectual, developmental, and/or sensory disabilities is increasing due to improved diagnosis and care of the common disorders.  There were multiple gaps in knowledge identified by a multidisciplinary group of experts at an NICHD-sponsored workshop focusing on women with physical disabilities in 2010.  This proposal is to develop a systemic and comprehensive registry of pregnancy course and outcomes among women with physical disabilities. However, the current goal is to focus on  women only with Cerebral Palsy and Spina Bifida.

The parent/guardian of children aged 4-18 years, with an isolated long bone fracture (clavicle, humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, and fibula including reduced fractures) that are discharged home, are eligible for enrollment. Overall, during the next 4 years we would expect at least 32,500 visits for children with a fracture. Overall enrollment and completed follow-up of eligible visits will provide 14,000 children for analysis.    These injuries have a slight predilection for males at a rate of 60% but both male and female children are eligible.    The parents of generally health children will be recruited. If the child has any other injuries or developmental/cognitive delays that make it impossible to report outcomes of interest, the parent/guardian is not eligible.     Strategically selected sites within PECARN will enroll patients including: Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (Chicago, IL), Children's Hospital Colorado (Denver, CO), The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA), Children's National Medical Center (Washington DC), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH), and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI).

If the child has any other injuries or developmental/cognitive delays that make it impossible to report outcomes of interest, the parent/guardian is not eligible. If the parent/guardian is unable to understand English or Spanish, or is inaccessible by text or phone he/she will be excluded. The parent/guardian will be consented in the ED to report their experiences after discharge.	\N	Primary Outcome: Pain-related function will be reported by text using AT-HOME once each day. This will be measured with the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measurement (PPPM). The PPPM is a 15 item observational checklist measure of pain intensity designed to be used by parents to assess acute pain at home. Each of the first seven days after ED discharge, a score will be generated ranging from 0-15. A score of 6 is defined as severe dysfunction. This study will compare the proportion of children that experience severe dysfunction any day after ED discharge for each of the at-home analgesic regimens recommended.    Secondary Outcomes: The number of doses of medications used will be described. This will inform best practice for adequate discharge prescription practices for children with these injuries. A comprehensive panel of measures was developed, and the choice of measures was informed by the Initiative on Methods, Measurements, and Pain Assessment in Clinical trials and reflected both the patient and parent's view of the impact of the treatment recommendation.    The use of balancing measures including adverse effects assesses the undesirable effects associated with analgesic use. Given the potential for opioid-related adverse effects, ability to detect these, included unused opioids available after the acute pain that may be available for subsequent abuse, misuse, and diversion.     As a part of secondary analyses, the recommended outpatient analgesic regimen reported will be compared to 1) the prescribed analgesics abstracted from the PECARN Registry, and 2) the analgesic actually used at home obtained via the mHealth AT-HOME Data collection.     Pain score at discharge from the ED will also be collected from the family utilizing At-HOME. The AT-HOME score will be reported using the Bieri Faces Pain Scale -Revised. It is considered the most valid and reliable measure of acute pain for school-age children (4-12 years of age), and has been widely used for decades. The scale includes 6 faces to enhance scoring scale compatibility with the 0-10 metric and conforms to a linear interval scale. The scale and instructions for use will be provided to the family at enrollment. On the day of discharge, the child will select one of 6 gender-neutral faces that reflect their pain at discharge, which is scored from 0 to 10. Moderate/severe pain is defined as a pain score of 4 or greater. Mild/no pain is defined as a score less than 4. This self-reported pain scale will provide valid and reliable data about the pain experience at discharge.	Strategically selected sites within PECARN will enroll patients including: Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (Chicago, IL), Children's Hospital Colorado (Denver, CO), The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA), Children's National Medical Center (Washington DC), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH), and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI).

The PECARN Registry has been queried in the development of this analytic plan. To account for differences in patient/biological characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), including severity of fracture variables such as extremity site (upper/lower), fracture reduction (N/Y), moderate/severe ED pain severity, we will utilize propensity score methods. Specifically, relevant biological variables such as sex will be accounted for in the analysis. Age and weight, both factors that can affect analgesic effect will be evaluated. The effect of site on medication use and outcomes will be specifically analyzed given the previously described variable practice patterns. We will estimate probability of home analgesic group using a multinomial regression model with predictors/confounders that have been systematically identified a priori by literature review and expert opinion. The predicted log-odds for each group will be used as propensity scores for each patient. We will check for balance in propensity scores across analgesic groups, and for balance in covariates between analgesic groups after stratification by propensity scores. We will use standardized difference and pre- and post-match distribution plot to verify where balance is attained and to select final propensity models. We will then compare analgesic groups with respect to the outcome of severe dysfunction using appropriate methods, based on the distribution of propensity scores. Patients in the group that is prescribed both an opioid and non-opioid will be compared to those in each of the other groups.      The analytic plan has been developed to control for bias, adjust for variation in severity and address relevant biological variables including sex. Our Registry query demonstrates cell sizes sufficient to account for severity and sex in our planned analyses.  These threats to validity have been critically appraised since the usefulness of this study and the adoption of its findings are dependent on the adequacy of the study design.    To account for differences in severity of fracture, patients will be analyzed within the severity cells described. Cells with insufficient numbers within a pain severity group will not be included in the analysis. The primary analysis will be a Mantel-Haenszel test of severe dysfunction, stratified by severity cell to compare the group with mild or no pain at discharge to the group with moderate or severe pain. A secondary analysis will test for an interaction between discharge pain and severity characteristics, using logistic regression. We will also check the consistency of results by looking at sex and within-site results. We will assess the association between discharge pain level and function within each of the severity groups.	\N	\N	\N	\N	4	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	No disclosures or conflicts of interest have been identified.	\N	\N	\N	f	A member of the research team will obtain consent and assent of eligible patients in the ED 10 hours per day, 7 days per week at all sites. Dedicated ED research coordinators are available at each of the sites for these hours to enable consistent recruitment of all eligible patients. Once eligibility is confirmed and informed consent is completed, the research assistant will obtain the phone number for communication via text to collect the patient outcomes. At enrollment, each site will implement an existing algorithm that will then assign a unique study ID based on the patient site medical record. Importantly, there will be no change in ED treatment or discharge instructions for study purposes. Families are provided their ED analgesia, discharge education and instructions, as well as discharge prescriptions per ED physician discretion.    Enrollment is expected at all sites by Month 7 and be completed at Month 55.    The goal to analyze data from 14,000 children would require each of the 6 sites to enroll 2 patients each day (58% of eligible and anticipate seasonal variation) resulting in 4,380 patients yearly. Lost to follow-up rate (due to attrition, phone number change, etc.) is expected to be 20% resulting in 3,504 patients yearly for each of the four years of enrollment, therefore achieving the goal sample size. Preliminary studies of texting follow-up after ED discharge successfully enrolled 66% of eligible parents with 15% lost to follow-up and/or missing data for outcomes reporting.43 These support the feasibility of performing this study.     Recruitment will be monitored on a daily basis and reported on a weekly basis to site investigators.

We also assess cognition at 3 months to provide an 'acute' MBSR endpoint, consistent with literature comparing interventions with different time scales. Secondary outcomes test intervention effects on everyday cognition (Cognitive concerns and Executive function), activity performance (OTDL-R), and social participation/engagement scales.

We expect to complete enrollment by March 2019 based on prior study enrollment data. At this time (June 2017), we have enrolled approximately 50% of our target accrual.	\N	\N	\N	\N	The four intervention conditions in this study are (1) MBSR, (2) intensity-focused multi-component exercise, (3) combined MBSR and exercise, and (4) Health Education (a control condition).  1. MBSR Intervention: Content includes instruction in mindfulness meditation practices, gentle mindful movement, and exercises to enhance mindfulness in everyday life. We use A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Workbook as a companion guide. Participants get daily at-home assignments with recordings of meditative practices. Subjects may be asked to track their daily practice on an electronic data collection device (tablet or personal device via status/post through REDCap) or by paper and pencil. We will ask if they are adhering to their home practice and intervene with prompts and counseling for those not keeping up with their home practice. Subjects will be asked to practice MBSR at home, with the goal of working up to 1 hour of practice per day.  2. Exercise Condition: Under the direct supervision of trained exercise instructors (three instructors per group), the exercise protocol is optimal for improving aerobic fitness and insulin sensitivity in older adults, as well as improving strength and balance and reducing indices of frailty. Each session consists of aerobic exercises and resistance training to improve fitness and insulin sensitivity, and exercises to improve balance, mobility, and flexibility which are an essential part of an exercise program in this age group. The rationale for our focus on multiple components rather than only one, such as aerobic exercise alone, is that aerobic exercise and resistance training each change these putative pathways and have been shown to improve cognitive function in older adults. Participants will complete 1 repetition max measurements (1RMs), determining the maximum amount of weight they can lift in one repetition at baseline, 6 months, and 18 months. Participants will record physiological and exercise information obtained during in-person exercise classes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, minutes of aerobic activity, etc.  Type Exercises Description  Aerobic  Treadmill, elliptical, bikes  Participants exercise so that their heart rate is approximately 65% of their peak heart rate and gradually increase the intensity of exercise with the goal of achieving a heart rate between 70 and 85% peak.  Progressive resistance training  Weight-lifting machines and functional movements  Participants perform 1- or-2 sets at a resistance of approximately 65% of their one-repetition maximum, with 8-to-12 repetitions of each exercise; they will gradually increase the volume and intensity with a goal of 2-to-3 sets at a resistance of approximately 80% of their one-repetition maximum, with 6-to-8 repetitions of each exercise. Also functional resistance training using whole body movements with either light weights or body weight as resistance.  Balance/mobility  Dynamic movements that challenge postural stability and mobility  Various gait patterns; walking on uneven terrain (simulated indoors, or outside); maneuvering around obstacles; use of stability balls for seated 'core' work; weight transfer forward/backward, side-to-side; eye tracking movements while seated, standing, slow walking.  Participants will also be prescribed 120 minutes of home exercise each week. The aerobic component will consist of walking, using exercise DVDs, and/or other aerobic activities; additionally, participants will be given a rotation of exercise activities for strength and balance-training exercises practiced in class that can be done safely at home. Subjects may be asked to track their daily practice on an electronic data collection device (tablet or personal device via status/post through REDCap) or by paper and pencil. We will ask if they are adhering to their home exercise and intervene with prompts and counseling for those not keeping up with their home exercise.  MBSR and Exercise condition: This condition will receive both MBSR and exercise as described above. In addition, 120 minutes of at-home exercise each week as well as daily, at-home mindfulness practice of up to 1 hour will be assigned and may be asked to be tracked via the tablet, personal device, or paper and pencil.  4. Health Education: This is a group-based intervention that increases health-related knowledge and action. Health Education improves chronic disease management, but it does not teach mindfulness techniques and does not involve exercise.	1	157	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	1	\N	Aim 1: Examine effects of MBSR, exercise, and their combination for remediation of memory and cognitive control, with secondary outcomes of everyday cognition, functional performance, and social participation and engagement.   We hypothesize that MBSR and exercise will each produce benefits in healthy older adults' cognitive performance, and combined MBSR with exercise will show greater cognitive improvements than either intervention alone.  Aim 2: Examine mechanistic changes that underlie cognitive remediation from MBSR and exercise.  We hypothesize a) a decrease in peak cortisol accounts for improvements with MBSR and b) increased insulin sensitivity, aerobic fitness, and BDNF account for improvements with exercise.  Aim 3: Examine whether the interventions cause changes in brain structure and structural connectivity and whether these plastic changes help to explain the cognitive improvements.  We hypothesize that improved functional connectivity within and across specific cognitive networks and increased volume of hippocampal and lateral prefrontal regions account for improved cognitive function with the interventions.  Aim 4: Examine predictors of variability in response to the interventions.

The intervention will be in a multi-site unblinded cluster RCT in patients with advanced HF (N=264) after initial referral to 4 mechanical circulatory support transplant centers for advanced heart failures therapies. These centers are Duke University, Northwestern University, Emory University, and the University of Pennsylvania.	19	A total of two hundred sixty-four (N = 264) HF patients (132/arm), new to tertiary care HF centers in the previous 6 months will be enrolled from randomized provider panels. The rationale for recruiting new HF patients is because this intervention is most relevant for such patients as they enter a new phase of HF care, that is characterized by complex treatment related decisions.  Provider Inclusion Criteria: 1) a HF specialty provider (attending physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) at the MCS-HF Clinic who provides direct patient care for those with HF, and 2) has at least 10 new patients assigned to their panel each year. All providers will provide informed consent and are free to refuse participation. Patient inclusion criteria: 1) referral and attendance at a MCS-HF Clinic within the previous 6 months with planned follow-up at that clinic over the ensuing 12 months, 2) diagnosis of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) from either systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and 3) ability to read, write, and speak in English. Patient exclusion criteria: 1) Short BLESSED cognitive score > 10 to rule out significant cognitive impairment [79], 2) diagnosis of a terminal illness with life expectancy of ≤ 1 year not related to heart disease, 3) psychiatric illness that interferes with study participation, and 4) age less than 18 years.	\N	The primary outcome is the proportion of GoC conversations that occur after the GoC intervention at a subsequent HF target clinic visit.  Secondary outcomes are: 1) quality of communication, 2) concordance between goals for treatment and care received, 3) satisfaction/regret with decision making, 4) identified treatment preferences, and 5) psychological distress    The primary outcome will be determined by asking the patient, two weeks after a HF target visit, if a GoC conversation occurred and if the outline was used. Secondarily, EHR documentation of the GoC conversation by the provider will be determined	Duke University, Northwestern University, Emory University, and the University of Pennsylvania.	\N	\N	\N	\N	The study will recruit an average of 66 patients/year. The estimated number of HF patients available at the identified PCRC centers is adequate for randomization. Patients will be enrolled over 54 months, with a 1 year follow-up    Data analyses, submission to peer-reviewed journals and final reports are expected 55-60 months after human subjects approval.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	24	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	GoC-HF intervention elements include: 1) Patient educational preparation for HF decisions and advance care planning, patient activation and skills practice; and 2) Provider familiarity with GoC communication for shared decision making in HF. The proposed study will test the effects of the GoC-HF intervention compared to an enhanced usual care using a randomized, 2-group, repeated-measures design.	\N	\N	101	\N	\N	20	\N	\N	Following data cleaning, preliminary analysis will include estimating reliability of scales (Cronbach alpha) and examining distributional properties and characteristics related to assumptions underlying the proposed statistical tests. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, percent) will be used to describe sample demographic and baseline variables. Using t-tests and chi-square tests we will test for baseline differences between treatment groups. Baseline variables that differ significantly between groups and/or predict GoC conversations, will be included as covariates in the outcome analyses. The study procedures and analyses will be conducted according to the intent-to-treat principle, the main analyses will compare all subjects randomized in the intervention group versus all subjects randomized to EUC, without regard to degree of compliance with interventions.

Each provider is expected to enroll 8 patients. The study will over recruit by 20% or 24 additional patients to account for attrition expected from the previous pilot study.	Many HF patients are unaware of the seriousness of their condition, and serious illness conversations occur late in the HF trajectory, indicating failures in end-of-life planning. Barriers to GoC conversations and referral to palliative care include the lack of clinician time and training, poor access to palliative care experts, prognostic uncertainty in HF, and unwillingness to change treatment trajectories until all therapies are exhausted [6-7]. Less than 19% of Medicare-age HF patients accessed palliative care services before death [8-9], a failure that is costly to the health care system [10]. After a GoC conversation, more advanced HF patients may access palliative care services, especially for those not eligible for advanced HF therapies.     The overall goal is fill a critical gap in HF care to promote GoC conversations that will result in concordance in care as patients face decisions related to advanced HF therapies.    To test the hypothesis that the proportion of patients in GoC-HF who have GoC conversations with their HF providers will be significantly greater when compared to enhanced usual care (EUC).  To test the hypothesis that patients in GoC-HF compared to EUC will demonstrate: a) improved quality of communication, b) concordance between treatment goals and care received, c) treatment preferences identified, d) increased quality of life, and e) stable psychological distress.  To describe the impact of the GoC intervention on the health care system with respect to: a) health care utilization and b) estimated health care costs.	\N	\N	\N	Structured conversations between providers and advanced HF patients, establishing values, goals and preferences, navigating barriers, and treating anxiety and depression	1	353	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	11	4	\N	\N	\N	Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the proportion of patients in GoC-HF who have GoC conversations with their HF providers will be significantly larger when compared to EUC.

Aim 3: To describe the impact of the GoC intervention on the health care system with respect to: a) health care utilization (number of unscheduled HF visits, HF readmissions, HF related ED visits), b) referrals to supportive services (palliative care, psychological care, rehabilitation), c) estimated health care costs, and d) intervention costs over 12 months    The overall goal is to fill a critical gap in Heart Failure (HF) care to promote goals of care (GoC) conversations that will result in concordance in care as patients face decisions related to advanced HF therapies.     Participants in both arms will receive similar contact with study staff. The staff recruiting patients, assigning new patients to provider panels, and collecting outcomes will be blinded to study arm.

We assume that the same number of patients will be hospitalized in the ICU per facility at each participating facility during the study. On the assumption that the pooled standard deviation (SD) is 3.0, the mean MSOFA difference between the intervention and the controlled ICUs to obtain 80% power with a type 1 error rate of 5% (2-tailed) are presented with various interclass correlations (ICC) in the table 1 attached. Since previous studies involving multiple centers in critical care medicine have reported an ICC between 0.001 - 0.05, power calculations were conducted in this range of ICCs. The pooled SD utilized in the calculation was estimated from the previous work from Grissom et al., in which the reported SD of MSOFA ranged from 2.7 to 3.2. If we assume 4 centers per treatment group (a total of 8 participating centers), a treatment phase of 5 months, and ICU recruitment of 38 patients per month, the sample size will be 750 patients per treatment group. With this number of patients, we have 80% power to detect a mean difference in MSOFA between 0.46-0.72.	19	Provider inclusion criteria:  •\tProviders (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) who evaluate ICU patients at their initial presentation.

We consider a MSOFA difference of 0.5 to be clinically meaningful. The secondary outcomes are lengths of ICU and hospital stay, days free from advanced cardiac, respiratory, and renal support, and 28-day hospital mortality.	We plan to include small to medium-sized community-based ICUs, including the ICUs run by acute care nurse practitioners. Since randomization of individual patients is often challenging in studies in acute care settings, a cluster randomized design is the most appropriate for assessing the impact of implementation of the new ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol. Our phone survey to critical care directors in the community-based ICUs revealed that a conventional cluster randomized trial is preferred to a stepped wedge design, because of its relative convenience in scheduling a 2-month education intervention period (randomized either pre- or post-implementation period) from an administrative perspective, without having significant methodological disadvantages. Additionally, conducting a clinical study in community-based ICUs, including the ICUS run by acute care nurse practitioners, where majority of people receive health care, is also essential to understanding effectiveness of an intervention in the real-world critical care practice settings.

Recruitment period (4 months): We plan to use website postings, flyers, and emails to recruit ICU's that meet the center inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study protocol will be shared with potential site investigators and coordinators. We will obtain data on the number of potentially eligible patients per month in each center. This data collection will also assist us with conducing block stratification in a subsequent randomization phase. Oral consent will be obtained from participating providers.      Randomization: Centers will be randomized to an ultrasound-guided evaluation (intervention) or a standard of care (control) group. They enter the study using a stratified block randomization to ensure balance in the number of sites assigned to the two groups. The blocks will be stratified by the number of potentially eligible patients identified in a recruitment period per ICU to ensure that particular center characteristic is balanced between the two groups.     Intervention period (2 months): Providers in the intervention ICUs will undergo a multi-media hybrid (online and on-site hands-on workshop) ultrasound education program. Subsequently, providers will be asked to take an ultrasound test at the end of this period to ensure their attainment of minimal ultrasound competency. Providers are expected to become proficient in identifying eligible patients, performing an ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol, and acquainted with a treatment suggestion algorithm. Providers in the control ICUs receive no education or guidance.     Implementation period (5 months): Providers at intervention ICUs will be encouraged to perform an ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol and consider proposed treatment suggestions on their eligible patients in their initial (mandatory) and follow-up (optional) evaluation. Providers will have ongoing access to online ultrasound education materials. Providers in the control ICUs will use a current standard approach in evaluating their patients. They will be allowed to use ultrasound if it is their preferred evaluation approach.     Post-implementation and data analysis period (7 months): Upon completion of the implementation period, patient data will be retrospectively collected via chart review and analyzed under intent-to-treat principles based on randomization at the ICU level. All ICU patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be analyzed regardless of providers' use of ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol, their ultrasound competency, or adherence to our treatment suggestion algorithm.

Oral consent will be obtained for study participation. We will collect providers' position (nurse practitioners, physician assistants, physicians, etc.), knowledge and skill test scores, and attainment of minimal ultrasound competency.     Patient data  Although there is no direct patient care related intervention, patients' protected health information (baseline characteristics, hospital course, morbidity, and mortality) will be collected retrospectively via chart review upon completion of the study implementation period. It would not be practically possible to obtain informed consent from all acutely ill patients or their surrogates at the time of initial clinical assessment. Obtaining a retrospective consent is also not practical in this patient population whose mortality is significantly high, and exclusion of such patient data will make the study unfeasible. Our intervention is the introduction of a structured non-invasive ultrasound-guided evaluation in the current clinical practice where an ultrasound examination has been performed in a non-structured, convenient manner. Therefore, we will request a waiver of HIPAA authorization and informed consent for patient study participation.  Study data will be analyzed under intent-to-treat principles based on randomization at the ICU level. All ICU patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be analyzed regardless of providers' use of ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol, their ultrasound competency, or adherence to our treatment suggestion algorithm.

Participants may receive up to $100 USD for completing all study visits.	Our original sample size was estimated at 1650, but because of recruitment difficulties over the 1st year of recruitment activity we have estimated we can enroll a population of about 1400 participants in the remaining years of the grant. There are no health status exclusions, with the main entry criterion being eligibility for lung cancer screening. If any health condition exists that precludes LDCT the subject would not be eligible for our study. The demographic group from which we will recruit is defined by people who are provider-referred or self-referred and meet eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening. In the Mayo Clinic lung screening program we have screened 835 patients in the past 12 months, 43% women and 57% men.  We will recruit smokers age 55 and up from the general population encompassing the catchment areas surrounding the study sites.  The study sites include hospitals in large metropolitan area is (Phoenix, AZ and Jacksonville, FL), medium-sized cities in the Midwest (Rochester, MN, population 115,000), and smaller rural or regional referral centers located in the upper Midwest (LaCrosse, WI population 53,000; Eau Claire WI, population 67,000 and Mankato, MN population 42,000).	46	Participants are recruited from a pool of patients who meet the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) risk criteria for lung cancer screening (LDCT).  Patients can self-refer for LDCT screening or (more commonly) are referred by a clnician. Patients call a Mayo Clinic phone number and complete a brief intake interview during which demographic information, smoking history, current smoking status, and other data for risk calculation are collected. Eligibility criteria (per CMS) for LDCT screening are: 1) age 55-77, 2) asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of lung cancer), 3) 30+ pack year history of smoking, and 4) current smoker or one who has quit smoking within the last 15 years.  Eligibility criteria for entry into our study include: 1) current smoking (past 30 days every day or some days), 2) at least weekly use of the Internet, 3) cell phone ownership with a text messaging plan, and 4) willing to receive study text messages. Exclusion criteria are current use of cessation medication or participation in a tobacco cessation treatment program.	\N	Effectiveness will be evaluated with the primary outcome of self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence which is biochemically confirmed with expired air carbon monoxide (CO) at 12 months post-randomization. All participants who self-report 7-day point prevalence abstinence and have an expired air CO concentration ≤10ppm at the 12-month follow-up will be confirmed as abstinent from smoking. Participants who do not complete the 12-month follow-up or decline CO testing will be considered smokers.     Other smoking-related outcomes include change in motivation to quit, quit attempts, 30-day and continuous abstinence measured at each follow-up.  Intervention satisfaction in all three arms will be measured with an adapted version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-3; α=.92). We will assess overall satisfaction and perceived helpfulness of the interventions, whether the intervention met their expectations (1=not at all, 5=very much), and whether they would recommend it to a friend (yes/no). In addition to overall satisfaction, we will measure satisfaction with specific intervention components. We will also assess participant engagement with the digital tools using metrics of time using the online resources and number of text messages received and responded to. We will assess the mediating impact of engagement on abstinence outcomes.	This multisite trial will include a mix of health care sites serving patients from varied and diverse communities across four states: three sites from the Mayo Clinic Health System, two Mayo Clinic campuses in urban areas, and a destination medical center in Rochester, MN, that serves patients from all 50 states.   Three MCHS sites that will participate in this study: MCHS Mankato, MN is a 270-bed acute care hospital as well as 4 family medicine clinics in Mankato and 3 surrounding smaller communities. It serves communities in Blue Earth, Le Sueur, and Nicolette counties in Minnesota with a catchment area population of about 178,545; 14% of the population is over 65 and smoking prevalence is 18%. MCHS La Crosse, WI consists of two hospitals and 11 outpatient clinics serving 10 communities in Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota with a catchment area population of about 250,000 people; 14.5% of the population is over 65 and the smoking rate in La Crosse County is 20.2%. MCHS Eau Claire, WI is an 80-bed hospital and network of clinics serving 3 cities and 10 towns with a total catchment area population of 101,438; 12.8% of the population is over 65 and adult smoking rate in the county is 18%.   Mayo Clinic (MC) has major campuses in Rochester MN, Scottsdale and Phoenix AZ, and Jacksonville FL; all three sites will participate in the trial. Mayo Clinic Arizona serves 100,000 patients per year through a hospital and outpatient clinic in Phoenix and an outpatient clinic in Scottsdale; 17.3% are older than 55 and adult smoking prevalence is 15.3%. Mayo Clinic Florida serves about 100,000 patients per year through a hospital and outpatient clinic in Jacksonville; 17% are over the age of 55 and adult smoking rate is 16.8%. Mayo Clinic Rochester Minnesota serves about 1.1 million patients per year through 3 hospitals and a multi-disciplinary outpatient practice. It is primarily a destination medical center with about 70% of the patients arriving from greater than 50 miles.  These sites include a mix of facilities that are large and small, urban and rural. This variety in study sites will ensure generalizability to other health care systems and LCS programs in moderate to large health care facilities.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Study is open for enrollment as of August, 2017 (year 2 of the 5-year grant).  25 participants have been enrolled at one site (Rochester, MN).   The study timeline and budget are currently being restructured with NCI due to large carry-over funds resulting from slow enrollment during year 2 of the project. With the restructure we expect for the study to run through a year 6, providing years 3, 4, and 5 of the grant to complete enrollment and allow for 12-month follow-up to be completed (year 6) for all enrolled subjects. The plan is to enroll 1400 patients at six sites over 3 years from September 2018 to August 2021. Analysis is schedule to be completed by August 2022.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	This is a 3-arm, multi-site (6 sites), randomized controlled trial with a repeated measures design that compares: 1) Ask-Advise-Refer Usual Care approach (UC), 2) digital approach (WEB+TXT), and 3) digital approach + TTS counseling (WEB+TXT+TTS). 1400 participants will be randomly and equally assigned to each arm.  Participants will not be blinded to their study condition.	\N	\N	35	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	To be conservative in our sample size calculations, efficacy estimates for UC are based on data  from patients in previous trials for lung cancer screening. We estimate that biochemically verified abstinence at 12 months for UC will be 10%. Efficacy estimates for WEB+TXT are based on several converging lines of evidence and we conservatively estimate that biochemically verified abstinence at 12 months for WEB+TXT will be 16%. Efficacy estimates for WEB+TXT+TTS are also based on several lines of evidence and we conservatively estimate that biochemically verified abstinence at 12 months for WEB+389 TXT+TTS will be 24%.    Unless otherwise specified, analyses use an intent-to-treat (ITT) approach that analyzes  subjects by treatment assignment. We will use descriptive statistics to summarize demographic data, tobacco use history and other baseline characteristics. Summaries will be generated for the entire sample and by treatment arm. Given the randomized design, we will not assess for significant baseline treatment differences. With the exception of the stratification variable, no covariate adjustment will be included in the primary analysis. For all exploratory analyses, two tailed p-values will be reported with no adjustment for multiple comparisons. In all cases, findings will be reported using point estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Model assumptions for each analysis will be validated and transformations or nonparametric methods will be utilized as appropriate.    We will examine potential moderators (e.g., screening result, gender, age) by analyzing  interactions between treatment and selected variables. We will examine treatment/moderator interaction term on outcomes after entering main effects. We will also explore moderators of the relationship between treatment assignment 441 and treatment utilization.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	There are no conflicts of interest for Mayo Clinic or for any study personnel.	\N	\N	\N	f	Study enrolls patients who have completed at least a brief telephone screen to determine eligibility for lung cancer screening.  In our current scheme, we can contact patients who have completed the phone screen and have a future appointment for lung cancer screening.  Although we have not activated it, we have approval to obtain informed consent remotely using the telephone and an electronic document signing program.  Before completing the screening CT scan every patient must complete a shared decision making process.  This is an in-person visit with a clinician who discussed his risks and benefits of lung screening and makes a final determination of the patient's eligibility.  Once this visit is completed the lung screening CT scan can be completed either the same day or at a future visit.  We are able to identify each patient who has a future appointment for shared decision making and CT scan.  We contact these patients by letter or by telephone to assess interest in the study.  Interested subjects can now complete informed consent on the telephone or may have an appointment scheduled to visit with the study coordinator for informed consent visit and completion of baseline data.  We are also able to contact patients within 2 weeks of completion of the CT scan to assess interest in the study.  Finally, we are able to provide study personnel to be present at the time shared decision making is completed to provide potential participants with information about the study prior to completing the CT scan.  Our first site opened enrollment in August 2017 (Rochester, MN). Additional sites have been delayed because of the enrollment problems we experienced in site #1. We need Rochester to enroll 12-15 subjects per month, and the other 5 sites will need to enroll 6-8 subjects per month for 30-36 months to meet targets. We had preliminary data suggesting we could enroll over half of all eligible subjects coming into the lung screening program. Recruitment is critically important since patients are coming primarily for lung screening, and not for smoking cessation.	\N	\N	\N	\N	This is a minimal risk study and does not include any drug, device or biologic intervention. There is no radiation exposure as part of our trial since the LDCT is performed as part of the clinical lung screening program managed through the Departments of Radiology and Pulmonary Medicine at Mayo Clinic. Dr. David Midthun, the co-PI on the trial, is also the Medical Director for the Mayo Clinic Lung Cancer Screening Program.  The interventions include the previously described digital resources comprised of an internet resource provided through Truth Initiative (BecomeAnEX.org) and text messaging program with content and programming provided by Truth Initiative.  The in-person intervention includes only counseling with no additional testing or invasive procedures.  The lung screening CT scan is provided through the clinical programs and is not supported by our trial.	1	393	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	6	\N	\N	\N	This study is a practical clinical trial to examine the effectiveness of two novel cessation interventions and a key aspect of their implementation jointly in one study. The effectiveness question is whether a combined digital/clinical intervention yields higher abstinence rates than a digital intervention alone. The implementation question is whether proactively linking smokers to digital treatment increases treatment uptake and engagement and improves outcomes compared to passive referral. These questions will be examined in a 3-arm randomized trial with repeated measures at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. We will randomize N=1400 smokers who present for LDCT lung cancer screening to one of three arms previously described: 1) Usual Care control condition (aligned with guidelines for "ask, advise, refer" approach), 2) a digital (WEB+TXT) cessation intervention in which participants will be proactively enrolled, or 3) a digital cessation intervention combined with Tobacco Treatment Specialist counseling (WEB+TXT+TTS). Primary aims are:   Aim 1 (Effectiveness): To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of WEB+TXT and WEB+TXT+TTS versus UC with regard to biochemically confirmed smoking abstinence at 12-months.  Aim 2 (Implementation): To examine whether proactive enrollment increases treatment use, and whether treatment use mediates the relationship between treatment assignment and smoking outcome.   Aim 3 (Reach & Adoption): To examine the representativeness of the study sample relative to all smokers screened for LDCT eligibility (reach) and potential for intervention implementation (adoption) among LDCT clinics.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	1400	\N	\N

To demonstrate feasibility of enrollment and identify the route of administration to be used in the subsequent RCT, we plan to administer GM-CSF to a minimum of 20 subjects (10 per group, IV vs SQ). Given that immunoparalysis is present in approximately one third of children with MODS studied to date, we anticipate needing to enroll a minimum of 180 children with MODS in the GRACE study.  All patients admitted to the PICU and CTICU at participating sites will be evaluated for study eligibility.	54	Inclusion criteria are admission to the PICU or CTICU at a participating site, age of 40 gestational weeks to less than 18 years of age, greater than or equal to 2 new organ dysfunctions measure by the proulx criteria compared to pre-sepsis baseline, and suspected infection as an MODS inciting event.  Exclusion criteria are unable to collect the required amount of blood due to subject blood draw limits, limitation of care order at time of screening, high risk or diagnosis of brain death, severe leukopenia as a result of myeloablative therapy, active immunosuppressive treatment for oncologic, transplant, or rheumatologic disease, known primary immunodeficiency disorder, myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasis, or autoimmune thrombocytopenia, known allergy to GM-CSF, Contraindication to SQ injection by ECMO, burns on greater than 5 % total body surface area, renal replacement therapy, known pregnancy, inability to collect and ship sample for immune therapy testing on MODS day 2, previous enrollment in GRACE study, or inability to receive study drug.	\N	Comparisons for this study will be primarily descriptive. The cohort will be characterized with simple statistical summaries, i.e. frequencies, means, standard deviations, medians, and interquartile ranges. An arm will be considered successful if 8 of the \ffirst 10 completing subjects in the arm have a good immune response, i.e. TNF alpha > 200 pg/mL on Day 4 and Day 8 after initiation of GM-CSF. We hope to illustrate the distribution over the treatment course of TNF alpha, IL-6, and IL-8. Pharmacokinetic modeling of GM-CSF will be conducted using non-linear mixed models as implemented in NONMEM (version VI, ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD).

Those who demonstrate immunoparalysis (TNF alpha response < 200 pg/ml) will receive a 7-day course of GM-CSF. Study drug will be administered in 4 sequential treatment arms. Enrollment will begin in the 125 dose IV arm. If 125 IV does not prove successful, we will move to the 250 IV dose arm. If an IV arm is successful, we will open a SQ arm of the same dose. If we begin with 125 SQ arm, then we will move to the 250 SQ arm if the 125 SQ arm is not successful. A successful dose and route is measured by the resolution of immunoparalysis in 8 out of the \ffirst 10 subjects in a treatment arm.    In cases were the treatment arm is not successful, as soon as a 3rd subject in an arm has failed, that arm is considered to have failed. If the treatment arm is at the 125 dose, we will escalate immediately without fully enrolling the 125 dose arm. If the study treatment arm is at the 250 dose, we will continue enrolling to fully complete the arm for the purpose of understanding the PK in the failed route. Enrollment will not stop early in a study treatment arm due to achieving 8 successes.

Following randomization, subjects will be assigned to either active treatment with apixaban or placebo control.  Each subject will then undergo follow up ultrasound imaging at 7 days (+/- 2 days), 14 days (+/- 2 days) and 90 days (+/- 7 days).  This ultrasound imaging study will focus on venous thrombus propagation into the proximal venous segments.  At each follow up, all venous segments of the involved lower extremity will be imaged.  This imaging should be performed at a site participating in this research project.   Patients will be called at Days 30 & 60 (+/- 7 days) to check their health status, adverse reactions and medications.     Patients will be instructed to report to the clinic immediately if they had any bleeding or symptoms of recurrent deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both. All suspected episodes of recurrent thrombosis will be investigated with the use of objective tests, according to prespecified diagnostic algorithms.  At 3 months (+/- 7 days), patients will return for a routine clinically indicated ultrasound and clinical assessment.    At 12 months (+/- 30 days), each patient will have a brief clinical evaluation.  This will include an assessment of bleeding or thromboembolic outcomes occurring after active study completion.  The Villalta survey will provide an assessment of the post-phlebitic syndrome.	Based on previously published observational studies and small randomized trials, an anticipated venous thromboembolic event rate of 12.6% within 3 months for patients randomized to placeo is expected (thrombus propagation rate of 5.4%, pulmonary embolism rate of 0.5% and recurrent venous thrombosis rate of 6.7%).   We hypothesize that the placebo arm will result in a 3 month event rate of 10%.  By comparison, thromboembolic outcomes in the AMPLIFY trial for those subjects randomized to apixaban was 2.3% at 6 months.  We therefore hypothesize that the apixaban arm will result in a 3 month event rate of 1.6% in the proposed trial.  Based on these assumptions, employing an overall two-sided significance of 0.05 and a target power of 80%,  a sample size of 121 per arm would be required. This estimate is rounded to 125/group (250 total) to account for minor attrition to the intention to treat analysis set.      Potential subjects will include both genders, ages 18 to 99 years, with confirmed acute calf vein thrombosis and able to provide written informed consent.  These subjects may be either outpatient or hospitalized.	19	Inclusion criteria will include both genders, ages 18 to 99 years, with confirmed acute calf vein thrombosis and able to provide written informed consent.  Exclusion criteria will include subjects under age 18, those who have received more than 72 hours of anticoagulant therapy or have a contraindication to anticoagulants.  Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 ml/min, severe liver disease, severe thrombocytopenia, short life expectancy, active bleeding or active cancer will be excluded.  Because of drug interactions and metabolism alterations, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP 3A4 inducers will not be allowed.	\N	The primary efficacy endpoint of this study will be thrombus propagation either within the calf veins or into proximal deep veins (popliteal, femoral or iliac veins), symptomatic or incidental VTE recurrence by day 90:   1.\tThrombus propagation:  The original calf DVT must be confirmed by either duplex ultrasonography, venography, CT, or MRI.  All patients will then undergo serial ultrasound imaging at 7, 14 and 90 days.  Propagation is defined by two criteria: (1) when a thrombus previously confined to the calf veins is found to extend into a proximal vein including popliteal, femoral or iliac veins of the ipsilateral limb or (2) if the thrombus extends but remains confined to the calf veins. The thrombus propagation must be confirmed by comparing the new imaging with previous imaging clearly showing extension into a proximal vein not seen on the original imaging study.  Thrombus propagation that remains confined to the calf veins must extend beyond 5 cm of the previous thrombus length, extend into a new venous segment (upper, mid, or lower), or involve a new vein (not previously involved) within the calf.    2.\tRecurrent DVT:  A recurrent DVT must be distinguished from the original thrombus by comparing serial imaging modalities.  In order to be classified as a recurrent event, there must be new filling defects evident on the second study not appreciated on the original images or an interval study clearly showing thrombus resolution.     3.\tPE: Symptomatic pulmonary emboli must be confirmed by either CT, MR or conventional pulmonary angiography or VQ perfusion imaging.      4.\tFatal PE:  PE based on objective diagnostic testing, autopsy, or death which cannot be attributed to a documented cause and for which PE/DVT cannot be ruled out (unexplained death).  5.\tIncidental VTE recurrence:  It is anticipated that recurrent venous thrombosis or thrombus propagation may be identified incidentally.  In order to be classified as an event, the thrombus in question must be confirmed by cross sectional imaging.      The primary safety endpoints will include any episode of major bleeding including fatal bleeding or any episode of clinically relevant non-major bleeding:  1.\tMajor bleeding: Major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding plus a hemoglobin decrease of ≥ 2 g/dL or transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells, or intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, pericardial or fatal bleeding.    2.\tClinically relevant non-major bleeding: Clinically relevant non-major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but associated with medical intervention, an unscheduled contact with a member of the health care team, or temporary cessation of study treatment.  The first secondary endpoint will include as assessment of the post-thrombotic syndrome as assessed by the Villalta score at one year time point from the time of the original ultrasound confirmed diagnosis.    The second secondary endpoint will be to establish the timing of thrombus propagation for those individuals who have suffered such an event.  The date of thrombus propagation confirmation will be compared to the date of the original DVT diagnosis for this purpose.	We are anticipating three participating sites, each with a vascular center platform.  The involvement of sites with such a platform will ensure that expertise in vascular imaging is available for establishing the original diagnosis and providing accurate follow up imaging assessment during the proposed follow up intervals.  For example, the Mayo Clinic Gonda Vascular Center is a multidisciplinary practice involving 49 physicians from disciplines including vascular surgery, vascular medicine, vascular radiology, cardiology, hematology, physiatry, rheumatology, dermatology, general internal medicine and podiatry. This practice is currently supported by 112 allied health personnel.  In 2016, there were 30,076 patient visits to the Gonda Vascular Center for the evaluation and treatment of a vast variety of vascular diseases.  \t  The Thrombophilia Clinic began seeing patients in January 1997 with the goals of providing comprehensive care for the patient with an acquired or familial thrombophilia, and performing translational research and graduate medical education in thrombosis and thrombophilia.  Major aims of the Clinic include acute outpatient management of DVT/PE, peri-procedure management of the chronically anticoagulated patient, assessment and recommendations for patients at high risk for postoperative VTE, and consultation for patients with suspected familial or acquired thrombophilia.  In addition the Center provides a chronic anticoagulation clinic with point-of-care testing.  The Center is located on the fourth floor of the Gonda Building and within the Gonda Vascular Center.  A multidisciplinary group of nine consultants staffs the Center, including specialists in Cardiovascular Diseases, Hematology/Oncology, and General Internal Medicine.  A nurse practitioner supervisor, two physician assistants, 4 advanced practice nurses and five registered nurses provide direct patient care for acute and chronic outpatient anticoagulation management services. Over 1,500 patients with a familial or acquired thrombophilia have been seen since the inception of the Thrombophilia Center, and the Center had over 31,000 patient visits in 2016 alone.   A major advantage of the Thrombophilia Clinic is the centralized location within the Gonda Vascular Center.  Adjacent to the Clinic is the Vascular Utrasound practice.  This practice includes 10 ultrasound rooms with 10 FTE sonographers and 2 FTE vascular radiologists.  This busy practice performs between 60 and 80 vascular examinations each day including venous ultrasound for the rapid diagnosis of acute DVT.  Once a patient is found to have an acute DVT, an immediate call is sent to the Thrombophilia team who provide rapid patient triage and prompt evaluation and treatment with anticoagulation initiation.  This system of prompt assessment and anticoagulation implementation has reduced referrals to the emergency department by over 90% for this purpose and has greatly improved the time to treatment of these patients.  Beyond providing prompt and efficient care for these patients, this system maximizes patient identification for randomization into clinical trials such as this.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Study duration will be 36 months.

The analysis of venous thromboembolic endpoint will primarily focus on those events which occurred during treatment.     Frequency of the primary endpoint will be tabulated by treatment arm without regard to the time the event was observed. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be used to compare the event rates by treatment group stratified by clinical site. The pooled estimate of the odds ratio will be used as the primary measure of association for the study.      In the event the primary outcome measure is not available on all participants, worst case imputation (i.e., assuming the missing participants were events) will be used.     An exploratory analysis will investigate the time to event is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of a VTE event, death, or an adverse event that results in termination of treatment (including vascular events).  Patients who were lost to follow-up, who withdrew informed consent before the end of the predefined study duration will be censored at the last day the patient had a complete assessment for study outcomes within the intended study period in this analysis. The incidence curves of VTE events will be plotted.  The incidence of VTE events will be summarized as a combined endpoint and separate endpoints by treatment arm.  The difference in the incidences of the combined endpoint at 3 months between treatment arms will be estimated and tested using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution.       Events observed 7 days after the end of treatment but before 30 days from end of treatment will be described.  All patients who received at least one dose of study medication will be included in the secondary safety analysis. The analysis of major bleeding plus clinically relevant non-major bleeding events will primarily focus on those events which occurred during treatment or within 7 days of treatment discontinuation. Major bleeding events observed later will be described separately.      Frequency of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding will be tabulated by treatment arm.  The incidence of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding will be summarized as a combined endpoint and separate endpoints by treatment arm.  The difference in the incidences of the combined endpoint at 3 months between treatment arms will be estimated and tested using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution. All tests will be conducted at the one-sided 0.05 significance level.	\N	\N	\N	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	14	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	A total of 250 subjects will be enrolled over a 2 year period for this study.  Enrollment will occur at 3 sites.  We anticipate that a sizable percentage of patients will be recruited from Mayo Clinic Rochester.  Patients will also be recruited from Mayo Clinic Eau Claire and Mayo Clinic La Crosse.  Both hospital in-patients and patients referred to the Thrombophilia Clinic for anticoagulation initiation will be recruited.  We have developed an electronic system of subject capture which uses a natural language processor technology to identify all subjects with acute DVT at our organization.  The tool scans all inpatient and outpatient records including radiology reports using search terms synonymous with venous thrombosis.  Generated lists are then sent at 4:00 AM daily to our study personnel for review.  Clinical records are then reviewed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Eligible subjects are then contacted for study participation.	Overview:  Phase IV, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center trial to evaluate whether a strategy of anticoagulation with Apixaban is more effective than serial ultrasound surveillance in the management of patients with calf DVT for the prevention of thrombus propagation, embolization or venous thrombosis recurrence.  For the two study arms, 250 patients will be assigned to receive either Apixaban or matching placebo for 3 months.  Subjects will undergo serial ultrasound imaging for assessment of thrombus propagation at 7, 14 and 90 days.   Study will include 3 sites within the Mayo Clinic Health System (single CTSA).    Objectives:  •\tThe primary objective is to evaluate whether a strategy of active anticoagulation with Apixaban is more effective than serial ultrasound imaging in the management of patients with isolated calf vein thrombosis (DVT) for the prevention of thrombus propagation, pulmonary embolism and recurrent venous thromboembolic events.    •\tThe principal safety outcome is to assess the combination of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding for subjects randomized to Apixaban vs. placebo control.    •\tThe first secondary endpoint is to evaluate whether Apixaban is more effective than placebo for the prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome at one year as assessed by the Villalta score.     •\tThe second secondary endpoint is to determine the timing of thrombus propagation.  The current understanding of thrombus propagation is that if it occurs, it will occur within the first 2 weeks of diagnosis.  This concept of timing of thrombus propagation is the basis for current guideline endorsed approach which limits the requirement for repeated ultrasound up to 2 weeks only.  Yet, this guideline recommendation has not been validated.  Our study is poised to verify this assumption.	\N	\N	\N	Patients randomized to oral apixaban will be treated with 10 mg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily for 3 months.  Patients assigned to oral matching placebo will take their tablets in a similar fashion.	1	243	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	24	3	\N	2	\N	The primary objective is to evaluate whether a strategy of active anticoagulation with apixaban is more effective than serial ultrasound imaging in the management of patients with isolated calf vein thrombosis (DVT) for the prevention of thrombus propagation, pulmonary embolism and recurrent venous thromboembolic events.

However, with this proposed sample of 30 participants (15 tetrabiopterin and 15 placebo), we can calculate the magnitude of treatment differences (tetrabiopterin - placebo) for the primary efficacy endpoint - the change from baseline to end of double- blind treatment in digital ulcer net burden (a continuous endpoint), or safety outcomes - characterized by the proportion of participants who experience an AE. There would be 80% power to detect an effect size (mean treatment difference divided by standard deviation) of 1.253 or greater with a two-sided type I error of 5% in the primary endpoint. Given the pilot nature of this Phase IIa study, the difference between mean change in digital ulcer net burden between tetrabiopterin and placebo that can be detected with sufficient power is large. Similarly, we can calculate power for safety outcomes for this sample size: there is 81% power to detect treatment differences of 51%. Descriptive statistics will be derived for all clinical variables, mean and standard deviation for continuous outcomes and percentages for categorical and dichotomous variables. The main outcome of interest is the mean change in digital ulcer net burden at the end of 16 weeks in the two groups. We will compare the mean change in the tetrabiopterin vs. placebo groups using an ANCOVA model, with treatment and baseline digital ulcer net burden as covariates. Extension of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to adjust for baseline digital ulcer net burden will be used if the assumptions of the parametric ANCOVA model are violated. We will also compare the proportion of patients with healing of the cardinal DU, the mean change in DU from baseline to week 16, the number of new DUs during the study, new ulcers or healing of ulcers, and the change in patient- reported outcomes (PROs) including Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) measures and global assessments by the patient and physician in the tetrabiopterin vs. placebo group using similar methods as used for the primary endpoint for continuous outcomes and Fisher's exact tests for discrete outcomes.    The p-values resulting from formal statistical tests will be interpreted from a hypothesis-generating, rather than a confirmatory framework.	\N	\N	\N	\N	13	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	36	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	Include a general description of enrollment plans and potential strategies to address potential challenges.

A convenience sample of adults with PMS will be recruited from the study sites. The multi-site design of the trial is intended to promote generalizability of the study results.     The sample size and power analysis were based on the pilot LA in SPMS trial in which LA had improved time to complete the T25FW (-0.54 seconds SD 0.36 vs 0.14 SD 0.25, p = 0.06). A sample size of 44 per group will have 80% power to detect a difference between the LA group with a coefficient, β1 regression slope of -0.50 seconds and the placebo group coefficient, β2 slope of -1.00, assuming that the standard deviation of the difference between the groups is 2.20 and the standard deviation of the residuals (repeated measures within each participant) is 1.80 with a 0.05 two-sided significance level and the correlation of 0.85 between the measurements over time, which if lower increases the power. A sample size of 59 per arm will allow for a 25% drop-out rate.    No special efforts will be undertaken to recruit specific sub-populations. Specifically, MS, like other autoimmune diseases, has a predilection for affecting women in a 3-4:1 ratio. Therefore we expect women to be adequately represented in this current study using a convenience sample. Minorities will not be preferentially recruited as there is no data to suggest a differential effect of LA on specific minority populations and/or with particular genetic characteristics. MS is rare in children, and progressive forms of MS rare within this small population. Therefore no children will be enrolled.    The pilot LA trial recruited 21 Veterans of the total 51 from VA Portland Health Care System which serves 2-300 Veterans with MS. The current proposed study has more restrictive inclusion criteria than the pilot study, requiring that subjects are ambulatory. Recruitment of non-Veterans and use of multiple VA and non-VA study sites is necessary to fulfill the enrollment	168	Inclusion criteria:  i.\tAge > 18 years.  ii.\tPrevious diagnosis of Relapsing remitting MS or Primary Progressive MS by 2010 revised McDonald criteria.   iii.\tCurrent Secondary Progressive MS or Primary Progressive MS.  iv.\tProgression of MS in the previous 2 years defined by medical record or reliable historical interview as:  a.\tNon relapse-related MS decline resulting in a 0.5 step change in EDSS, decline in T25FW, or other clinically documented decline (can be assigned retrospectively) if not on a disease-modifying therapy, OR  b.\tIf currently on a DMT, non relapse-related MS decline resulting in a 0.5 step change in EDSS, decline in T25FW, or other clinically documented decline (can be assigned retrospectively) while on the current disease-modifying therapy taken continuously for at least 1 year prior to enrolment.  v.\tAble to give informed consent and to adhere to study procedures.  vi.\tEDSS 3.0 to 6.5.

Secondary mobility outcomes are changes in the 2 Minute Timed Walk and fall counts for consistency of the effects of LA on mobility. Additional clinical secondary outcome measures are changes in neurological disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS), tests of manual dexterity (9 Hole Peg Test) and cognition (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, California Verbal Learning Test- Second Edition, and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test- Revised). Questionnaires using the Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information Systems (PROMIS) will be used to assess pain intensity, pain interference, and ability to participate in social roles. Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), sleep (Last Night Sleep Quality and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Assessment), and fatigue (Modified Fatigue impact Scale) will also be captured.     Tertiary outcomes of safety and tolerability will utilize safety laboratory tests at 6 of the 7 visits, adverse event reporting, and development of suicidality (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale).	This study plans on including 3 VA sites (Portland Oregon, Puget Sound Health Care System, District of Columbia) and 4 Non-VA sites (University of Vermont; Swedish MS Center; University of Utah; University of Alabama; Oregon Health and Science University). Note that the PI (Dr. Spain) has a joint appointment at the Portland VA and the Oregon Health and Science University and that site will include both the Portland VA as well as the Oregon Health and Science University.     Additional sites may be considered if recruitment is slow. A site in Canada is being considered but is not officially a part of this protocol at this point.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Study timeline and visit scheduling.

Thereafter study visits will occur +/- 2 weeks from the ideal visit based on the month (M) zero visit.

We will use the transformation 25/T25FW, which is the walking speed in feet per second. In constructing these models for the T25FW walking speed outcome, we will incorporate as a predictor the factor used for randomization, baseline disability. We are primarily interested in whether there is a difference between the treatment groups in the T25FW rate changes. Given evidence of interaction, comparisons of both 12 and 24 month change between the treatment groups will be made, using a Bonferroni multiple comparison adjustment for two time points of interest. Additional models will include as covariates, baseline measures of disease duration and use of MS medications if significantly related to the response when added to the original model or result in a 10% change or greater in the estimated overall treatment effect. Secondarily, we will compare with a t-test or nonparametric tests the proportion of participants who demonstrate clinically significant worsening in gait defined by a 20% improvement in the T25FW and/or 2MTW and/or requires greater assistance to walk (e.g. newly require a cane, transition from cane to walker, etc.). We will do sensitivity analyses using an intention to treat analysis with the cross-over with and without participants who have a change in their disease-modifying therapy during the course of the study. We will add compliance information as determined by pill-counts to the mixed model.   The impact of LA on falls frequency will be assessed by comparing changes in fall frequency from the first to the last 3 months. A principal intention-to-treat analysis using linear Poisson mixed models to evaluate the association between time period, fall frequency, and group allocation will test the hypothesis that fall frequency is reduced more by LA than placebo. Mixed models will be used to correct for autocorrelation of within-subject repeated measures and allow for missing data, and include covariates associated with falling such as age, level of disability, and use of a walking aid. As exploratory secondary outcome measure, we will investigate the disconjugate composite endpoint based on sustained change in EDSS, clinically significant worsening in gait as defined above, or 20% increase in 9HPT.  The mixed model approach will compare the mean rates of change from baseline in brain as measured by SIENA. Age, sex, and disease duration will be used as covariates along with disability as determined by the randomization method.    We will tabulate all adverse and serious adverse events and compare the differences in the occurrence and the frequencies between the two groups. The frequency of side effects will be compared using χ2 tests or Fisher's exact test as appropriate depending on the number of adverse events seen.  For evaluation of patient safety, laboratory test results at baseline and changes from baseline will be summarized and compared using t-tests for continuous measures and Fisher's exact test for proportions	\N	\N	\N	Canada - note that this site is under discussion; and is not counted in the total estimated number of sites	11	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	30	There are no financial ties or other conflicts of interest by any study team member or study team organizations related to this study.	t	\N	\N	f	The anticipated study recruitment period is for the first 18 months once the study is approved at the first study site or until enrolment is completed, whichever occurs first. The study will end when the last participant exits the study. There will be no more than 60 days inclusive between the screen and baseline visits. Thereafter study visits will occur +/- 2 weeks from the ideal visit based on the month (M) zero visit.     Estimation is that it will take 6 months for all the sites to have gained IRB approval and start recruiting. Recruitment is likely to be equal between sites (approximately 10-15 per site) with the exception of the principal site, the VA Portland Health Care System, which is the site of the PI and is likely to recruit 15-25 due to local enthusiasm for the study.  The enrolment period of 18 months means that sites will need to recruit less than subject per month or less. This is in line with the recruitment rate of a pilot study of LA in a progressive population at the Portland site.	Study Design: This study is a phase 2, double-blind, multi-center randomized controlled trial to compare the daily administration of 1200 mg oral LA to a placebo, as a disease-modifying treatment in PMS. A total of 118 subjects with PMS will be randomized 1:1 to LA or placebo. None of the study procedures involve usual care.     The primary objective is to determine if LA is superior to placebo in reducing the clinical decline (progression) in people with PMS. This will be measured as the ability of LA over placebo in maintaining mobility as measured by the primary outcome of change in completion time of the Timed 25 Foot Walk.	\N	\N	\N	The intervention is the daily administration of 1200 mg oral LA or a placebo. Source of investigational drug. Source of investigational drug: Pure Encapsulations®, which follows Good Manufacturing Procedures in their production of LA, will provide gelatin capsules containing 600 mg of LA and the encapsulated placebo rendered to appear similar to LA.   Investigational New Drug (IND). Dr. Spain holds an IND for testing LA in PMS (#110132). The current proposed study will be added as an amendment to the current IND. Reporting requirements to the FDA will be followed.  Labeling: The investigational product will have a label that will be visible on the pertinent storage containers. The label or labeling of an investigational new drug shall not bear any statement that is false or misleading in any particular and shall not represent that the investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated.  Blinding. Blinding will be implemented by the study site research pharmacies using identical containers, and instructions. The VAPORHCS Central Research Pharmacy will maintain a master record of subject assignment. Subjects and all personnel involved in conducting the trial will remain blinded to treatment assignment and undergo a blinding questionnaire at study end.    Duration of treatment: Treatment with study drug will be for 2 years and continue until the final study visit if postponed for any reason other than safety concerns per protocol.	1	205	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	41	7	\N	2	\N	The primary objective is to determine if LA is superior to placebo in reducing the clinical decline (progression) in people with PMS.

0	\N	6	\N	\N	\N	6 months	Eligibility criteria will include 1) self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, 2) age between 18 and 70 years, 3) receive primary care at one of the participating clinical sites, 4) at least one office visit within the previous 12 months to the primary care site, 5) diagnosis of T2D in the medical record, 6) T2D diagnosis for six months or longer, 7) most recent hemoglobin A1c≥8%, and 8) intention to continue to receive medical care at the recruitment clinic for the next six months.  The value of 8% is higher than the goals established by the American Diabetes Association Guidelines (hemoglobin A1c<7%)98, but lower than the definition of poorly controlled T2D established by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Core Quality Measures Collaborative (hemoglobin A1c>9%)99.  It is common practice to increase an individual patient's goal hemoglobin A1c value in the context of clinical and social co-morbidities, but this goal value rarely exceeds 8%.  Furthermore, the Minnesota Department of Health has defined poorly controlled T2D as hemoglobin A1c≥8% for the purposes of mandatory reporting by clinical sites across the state100.  Therefore, we will use this value in keeping with common clinical practice to determine eligibility for the study.             The first step in screening for eligible participants is identification of Hispanic patients at both study sites with T2D.  Per state-wide reporting mandates, each site maintains registries of their primary care patients with diabetes and the most recent hemoglobin A1c value for each patient.  The second step in screening is to identify Hispanic adults within the subset of patients with the most recent hemoglobin A1c≥8% at both sites. Both sites have identified mechanisms for accurately identifying eligible patients (see letters of support).  In our pilot study, we identified 3,025 eligible patients across both sites. Based on our pilot data, we expect to recruit approximately 50% women.  Children were not included because of perceived community need that resulted in an intervention created for adults, and because of the relatively higher prevalence of T2D among adults.    Our preliminary data suggest that we may expect a moderate effect size for the intervention (25%-50% times the standard deviation).  This is similar to two recent meta-analyses127,128 of related work that informs the effect size we can expect to observe in the proposed study. The first meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials examined the efficacy of diabetes self-management education added to usual care among Hispanic patients in primary care settings, which produced an average hemoglobin A1c reduction of 0.25 standard deviations127. The second meta-analysis of 20 randomized trials evaluated the efficacy of diabetes self-management education among racial/ethnic minority populations, which showed a similar hemoglobin A1c reduction of 0.31 standard deviations128.  While these effects sizes are smaller than that of our pilot study, we have picked the more conservative (lower) estimate of effect size to ensure ample sample size.  Hence, we can expect an effect likely to be between 0.25 and 0.31 standard deviation for the type of intervention proposed. Required sample sizes for an independent samples t-test to detect these two effect sizes, assuming 80% power, a two-tailed alternative and a 5% Type I error rate, are 252 and 145 patients per group, respectively.  With 200 patients per group, we will have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.28 standard deviations via the independent samples t-test.  Accounting for approximately 12% loss to follow-up, we intend to recruit 225 patients in each group, for a total sample size of 450 participants.	18	Eligibility criteria will include 1) self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, 2) age between 18 and 70 years, 3) receive primary care at one of the participating clinical sites, 4) at least one office visit within the previous 12 months to the primary care site, 5) diagnosis of T2D in the medical record, 6) T2D diagnosis for six months or longer, 7) most recent hemoglobin A1c≥8%, and 8) intention to continue to receive medical care at the recruitment clinic for the next six months.	\N	The primary outcome will be glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c 3 months after intervention delivery.

Study Sites       Both clinical sites participated in the pilot testing of the intervention and in refinement of study procedures for the proposed trial. Our letters of support indicate strong investment and commitment to accomplish this study, and study personnel have been identified at both sites:   •\tHennepin County Medical Center (HCMC), Minneapolis, MN. HCMC is a large public academic healthcare institution that provides primary care to approximately 90,000 patients in Hennepin County, MN, a large proportion of whom are Hispanic.  Members of our study team have worked with HCMC investigators for the past three years on diabetes care for immigrant patients.    •\tMountain Park Health Center (MPHC), Phoenix, AZ.  MPHC is a community health center with more than 30 years of experience. MPHC provides primary care for approximately 60,000 patients.  Demographically, the vast majority of patients seen at MPHC are Hispanic.  MPHC has a long history of mission-driven research collaboration with Mayo Clinic.           Rationale for study site selection.  The study will take place at HCMC and MPHC because of their high volume of adult Hispanic patients with T2D, their strong history of research collaboration with Mayo Clinic, and because of a personal history of collaboration between the PIs and site-PIs (including pilot work for this application).  The intervention was initially created with RHCP community partners and Rochester, MN was included as a pilot site.  As in the pilot study, Mayo Clinic team members who have substantial expertise with clinical trial coordination and oversight will continue to perform this role (i.e., coordination and oversight) in the proposed study as described below.	\N	\N	\N	\N	36 months	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	We will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial in primary care clinical settings at two healthcare institutions among 450 Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D (hemoglobin A1c≥8%).

The primary outcome will be glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c 3 months after intervention delivery.

The impact of concomitant covariates, including sex, age, and socio-economic status, on the sensitivity of the intervention effect will also be explored.	\N	\N	74	\N	\N	53	\N	\N	Aim #1: Evaluate the efficacy of a community-derived digital storytelling intervention among Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D.       The primary analysis will be an independent samples t-test between the group average hemoglobin A1c values at 3 months. A two-sided alternative with a 5% type I error rate will be employed.              Supplementary analysis for the primary endpoint. Repeated measures modeling of the individual time point A1c values (including chart abstracted values at approximately 6 months) will allow for a more detailed investigation to the timing of the impact of the intervention by including all time points (including baseline). Profile analysis (Srivastava) will further assess for difference in overall means, time point, and treatment by time interactions. Covariates indicated above including demographics and clinical covariates will be included in the repeated measures and profile analysis models to assess the sensitivity of the primary analysis conditional on these potential concomitant (mediating) influences.         Secondary analyses. The analyses applied to the primary endpoint will also be applied to each of the secondary endpoints. The subscales from the SDSCA (general diet, diabetes diet, physical activity, diabetes medication use, blood glucose monitoring) and the physical measurements (blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, BMI) will be compared between groups using t-tests and repeated measures monitoring similar to the primary endpoint. As we have a single variable primary endpoint defined, there will be no adjustment for comparison-wise Type I error rate.  Additional analyses will be performed to identify potential effect modifiers for the primary and secondary outcomes, i.e., sex, age, socioeconomic position, acculturation, health literacy, and diabetes knowledge.         Missing Data. Our group has pioneered the use of sensitivity analysis and produced a macro which examines the stability of results by implementing 20 different imputation approaches for comparison including last value carried forward, mean, minimum, maximum value carried forward, simple single imputation, multiple imputation, nearest neighbor imputation and Bayesian methods. This macro will be applied to the primary and all key secondary endpoints (diabetes self-management behaviors, diabetes self-efficacy, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, BMI) and summarized by indicating the number of the methods producing different results. In our experience, with data that has fewer than 20% missing data, an average of more than 15 of the 20 methods produced the same experimental finding.    Aim #2:  Explore the effect of the digital storytelling intervention on proposed theory-based mediators of change.    We will examine the correlational structure of the covariates and their impact on the intervention effect size via repeated measures models. We will include procedures suggested by MacKinnon129,130 to assess mediation, fitting three general estimating equation models to the data.  We will first estimate the intervention effect separately for the dependent variable (with regression adjustment for covariates); that model provides an estimate of the total effect of the intervention.  Next, we will estimate the intervention effect for each mediator (with regression adjustment for covariates); that model provides an estimate of the effect of the intervention on the mediator.  Finally, we will estimate the mediated intervention effect for the dependent variable by adjusting for the mediator (and covariates); that model provides an estimate of the unmediated (i.e., direct) intervention effect, and the intervention-adjusted effect of the mediator on the dependent variable.  These analyses will be done for the primary endpoint and each of the secondary endpoints to identify any mediators of the study results.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	18	None.	\N	\N	\N	f	First enrollment at both sites in March 2019.

The digital intervention package, which is 12 minutes long, includes a brief introduction by an RHCP community partner, four stories with transitions, and a short closing educational message re-enforcing the four diabetes self-management behavioral goals (healthful diet, physical activity, medication adherence, glucose self-monitoring).  The storytellers include two women and two men; they reflect some of the heterogeneity among Hispanic/Latino subgroups (two Mexican, one Central American, and one South American) in the U.S.  After obtaining consent in the clinical setting, study staff will deliver the intervention in the exam room or in a separate private room.  We chose to have the patient view the video on-site so that all participants are exposed to the video, ensuring adherence.        Following the video exposure, study staff will ask these questions to each participant and record their answers: 1) What is your reaction to the video?, 2) What was the main message of the video, and 3) Does the video motivate you to make any changes to the way you manage your diabetes (probe positive responses)?  These questions will confirm participant receipt of the intervention, which is an important fidelity construct to ensure that participants received and understood the intervention101.          Participants will be offered a copy of the video either as a portable storage device (i.e., "flash drive") for viewing on a computer or a DVD for viewing on a television.  Participants will also be provided access to the storytelling intervention as an application on their mobile phones and/or tablets.  In our pilot of the storytelling intervention, all participants cited the use of mobile smart phones.  Study staff will offer to assist participants in downloading this application during the baseline visit, and encourage participants to watch the video with family members or friends within their support network.          Rationale for implementation in the clinical setting.  The work proposed in this application is intentionally placed on the boundary of the efficacy-to-effectiveness transition102 in clinical trials.  We considered conducting a more traditional efficacy study, where participants would be invited to separate study visits for intervention delivery and measurements.  However, interventions that target improvements in diabetes self-management behaviors cannot be easily disarticulated from the clinical setting.  The hypothesized patient activation that may occur as a result of exposure to the digital storytelling intervention requires interaction with their healthcare home in order to translate that activation into improved outcomes.  Therefore, we pilot tested the intervention in primary care-based clinical settings.  We demonstrated feasibility of this approach while adapting intervention implementation for both sites.              Mobile short message service.  Mobile short message service, i.e., text messaging, has been shown to have some impact on diabetes self-care104 and cardiovascular-related lifestyle105 behaviors. Furthermore, a Cochrane review suggested moderate evidence for increasing self-efficacy for diabetes self-management using mobile phone messaging106.  Therefore, to increase the likelihood that participants will watch the storytelling video several times during the intervention interval, participants will receive a monthly automated text message (five total) that asks them to self-rate their motivational level and self-efficacy for managing their T2D (0 = no motivation/self-confidence to 10 = extremely motivated/confident), and will recommend that they watch the storytelling intervention if they score lower than a 7.          The rationale for the addition of mobile messages is that this intervention augmentation re-enforces concepts consistent with our theoretical framework.  It increases the potential treatment dose while maintaining an intervention package that is highly scalable.  As stated above, our pilot data indicate ubiquitous smart phone use among potential study participants.	1	385	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	\N	\N	\N	Specific Aim #1: Evaluate the efficacy of a community-derived digital storytelling intervention among Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D.    Hypothesis 1: The digital storytelling intervention will significantly improve glycemic control and diabetes self-management behaviors among Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D compared with controls.     We will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial in primary care clinical settings at two healthcare institutions among 450 Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D (hemoglobin A1c≥8%).  The intervention group will view the 12-minute digital storytelling video.  The comparison group will receive usual clinical care. The primary outcome will be glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c 3 months after intervention delivery. Secondary outcomes will include diabetes self-management behaviors, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, and body mass index.  The impact of concomitant covariates, including sex, age, and socio-economic status, on the sensitivity of the intervention effect will also be explored.      Specific Aim #2: Explore the effect of the digital storytelling intervention on proposed theory-based mediators of change.    Hypothesis 2: Digital storytelling intervention effects on diabetes outcomes will be mediated by social cognitive   constructs (self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, social support) and narrative factor constructs (story identification and transportation).    We will assess whether these theoretical factors impact the relationship between intervention effects on diabetes outcomes. A conceptual framework for potential mechanisms will be constructed to describe how digital storytelling may improve these outcomes.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	\N	450	\N	\N

Participants will be selected if they present to a participating site ED with a distal radius fracture or medial epicondyle fracture. Participants must be amenable to randomization. Ages have been selected based on consensus of the IMPACCT consortium that these age ranges present the most pressing need for evidence to guide clinical decision making.	\N	At the completion of this proposal period for the R34, we expect to have a consortium of sites ready to initiate the proposed trials. We plan to submit a U01 proposal to NIAMS following the completion of the objectives of the R34 planning grant proposal.	The IMPACCT Consortium currently has 35 members from 33 pediatric hospitals.

The IMPACCT (Infrastructure for Musculoskeletal Pediatric Acute Care Clinical Trials) is proposes two multicenter study questions on medial epicondyle fractures (MEF) and distal radius fractures (DRF). These two upper extremity fractures have high treatment variation without consensus on care. Our ultimate clinical trial will evaluate two common treatments for these fractures based on patient reported outcome scores (PROMIS Pediatrics Upper Extremity) at one year after the injury. Currently, the IMPACCT Consortium is pursuing an R34 funding mechanism with NIAMS to support the planning phases of a clinical trial on these fractures. A U01 grant submission would follow the R34.    The Organizational Aims of the R34 grant will prepare us to complete the proposed clinical trials:   1.\tIdentify sites for subject recruitment, implement standardized agreements and complete the central IRB process.  2.\tDevelop a recruitment and retention plan and conduct model recruitment to test feasibility.  3.\tDevelop the infrastructure to complete the planned trial including the manual of operating procedures, the quality and data management plan, and case report forms.   At the 2017 IMPACCT Consensus Conference MEF and DRF were identified by the participants to have the equipoise necessary and are the priority questions to answer with the proposed trials. The trials are proposed simultaneously to take advantage of the economy of scale and are similar in terms of anatomic location, outcome measures, and whether intervention is necessary.     The Scientific Aims of the IMPACCT initiative will challenge an existing clinical practice:  1.\tMedial Epicondyle Project: Determine if the PROMIS functional scores in non-operatively treated medial epicondyle fractures are similar when compared to those treated operatively.  2.\tDistal Radius Fracture Project: Determine if PROMIS functional scores in a 100% displaced and minimally angulated distal radius fracture that is left unreduced is similar when compared to those that were realigned.	\N	\N	\N	The study intervention for the U01 proposal is a procedure that achieves formal anatomical realignment for the fracture. For these upper extremity fractures, patients are either treated by realigning these injuries in their original anatomic position or allowing the fracture fragments to heal in their current positions with cast immobilization and no formal reduction. Currently, there is a high variability in which treatment patients receive, with approximately 50% of patients with a medial epicdondyle fracture going to the OR for formal reduction or just getting a cast in the emergency department. We have high equipoise among our consortium surgeons about which treatment is best for these fractures. Additionally, they are willing to randomize patients between these treatments.	2	318	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	15	32	\N	2	\N	The objectives of this proposed planning grant are to complete the necessary clinical trial planning activities and operational aspects of a multicenter trial.

Subjects will be administered drug or placebo for 5 days. This estimated sample size makes assumptions about the behavior of cytokines after injury and the anticipated effect of drug. Based on analysis of the literature and using IL-1β as a representative cytokine, the sample size of 25 per group has 80% power to show that the drug reduces the peak concentration of IL-1β by 66% (from 9.9 to 3.3, with standard deviation 8.2) based on the power of a two sample t-test (one tailed test of significance at the 0.05 level).  This study will measure changes in inflammatory cytokine profiles in CSF over time.  Since CSF samples will be collected over time, a repeated measure analysis of variance will be constructed to compare the profile of mean response for each biomarker over time between the two arms. Since cytokine values tend to be right skewed especially among injured subjects, log transformation may be needed for some of these endpoints. Since cytokines are influenced by the presence of other injuries or co-morbidities, these will be included as potential covariates in the analysis. If the log transformation fails to yield satisfactory results, then an analysis based on ranks will be considered as well. Although there are many potential endpoints, no adjustment for control of the Type I error rate will be made since this is an exploratory study. However, interpretation of significant results will acknowledge this as a potential limitation of the findings. Statistical significance will be determined at the 0.05 level throughout.	\N	\N	\N	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2	Scientific Founder of Northwestern start-up, ImmunoChem Therapeutics LLC, formed to commercialize the technology.	t	\N	\N	f	\N	TT301/MW189, a small molecule, is being developed for the treatment of TBI. The development program is based on nonclinical evidence that TT301/MW189 reduces the recruitment of activated microglia, reduces cerebral edema, and improves motor skills and neurocognitive outcomes in animal models of neuroinflammatory disorders. This study will assess the safety and tolerability of TT301/MW189 in injured patients and provide proof-of-concept pharmacodynamics endpoint results. This is a Phase 2a multi-center study with 6 to 8 sites, assuming recruitment of ~1 subject per month per site. Patients will be randomized to drug or placebo in a 1:1 ratio; n=25/group.

Evidence from clinical studies and preclinical animal models suggest the importance of proinflammatory cytokine overproduction from activated glia as a potential driving force for pathology progression in TBI. In both animal models and human head injury patients, TBI induces a robust increase in cytokine levels in the brain that occurs in the first several hours to days after insult and then subsides. There is extensive evidence that this acute cytokine surge is a key contributor to subsequent synaptic and cognitive dysfunction and other neurologic sequelae of TBI.  This mechanistic linkage, and the attractive therapeutic time window of hours post-insult, provide a rational therapeutic target for intervention in the trauma center setting.   TT301/MW189 is being developed for the treatment of TBI. The development program is based on nonclinical evidence that the drug reduces the recruitment of activated microglia, reduces cerebral edema, and improves motor skills and neurocognitive outcomes in animal models of neuroinflammatory disorders (TBI, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and Alzheimer's disease) (see James et al., 2012). TT301/MW189 has completed the preclinical drug development process; IND-enabling pharmacokinetic/ toxicology studies revealed no significant liabilities. Importantly, TT301/MW189 has also completed two phase 1a human clinical trials with no safety issues after single doses. TT301/MW189 is currently undergoing a phase 1b multiple ascending dose clinical trial in healthy human volunteers (NCT02942771).	1	354	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	14	8	\N	\N	\N	Primary aims of the trial:   To assess the safety and tolerability of TT301/MW189 when administered iv to patients with non-penetrating traumatic closed head injury, with clinical indication for an external ventricular drain (EVD). Intravenous (iv) administration of drug or placebo q12 (every 12 hrs) x 10 doses (first dose initiated within 6 hours of injury).    Secondary aims:   Exploratory pharmacodynamics (PD) endpoints: Determine whether the profile of selected CSF or serum inflammatory cytokine biomarkers is modulated by TT301/MW189 administration.  Monitor secondary clinical endpoints at the 30-day and 90-day follow-up visits to assess functional outcome. It should be noted that this pilot study is not powered for efficacy; nevertheless, the clinical assessments may provide some suggestive evidence for a functional effect of drug and will help inform the design of future larger trials.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	8	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	50	\N	\N

The focus will be specifically on immigrants who, once residing in the U.S., belong to one or more U.S. racial/ethnic minority populations (i.e. Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians, or Pacific Islanders). Among these, we are interested in distinct immigrant sub-populations based on the country of origin, rather than larger racial/minority populations when feasible (e.g., Koreans, Vietnamese, Cambodian, etc., rather than Asian Americans).  Racial and ethnic minorities are influenced by various degrees of skepticism related to trial participation.  We anticipate multilevel approaches to address barriers to study participation, such as, distrust; discomfort with inherent uncertainty of trial participation, negative connotation of clinical trial, low education level, and language discordance. For example, in the target populations in Chinatown, Boston and Brownsville, Texas, the potential barriers are low education levels and language discordance.	27	Adult patients identified will be eligible if they are 1st generation immigrant, belong to one or more U.S. racial/ethnic minority populations, and diabetic with a HbA1c 7% or greater. Patients will be excluded if they have had a serious life-threatening non-cardiac comorbidity with a life expectancy of less than 5 years (AIDS or cancer for example), had a serious physician recorded psychiatric morbidity or neurologic impairment that would preclude participation in their own care. In addition, a family member who either lives with the participant or provides caretaking on a regular basis, will be recruited into the study.	\N	We propose a multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a C-DCM delivered by CHW teams versus clinic/hospital-based Usual Care in improving diabetes outcomes in immigrant populations.

The sample size is representative of healthcare providers working specifically with pediatric obesity and weight management populations within health clinic settings.  Participants will be screened for eligibility utilizing the inclusion/exclusion criteria before consenting takes place.  We estimate that 5-8 sites will be needed to reach the recruitment goal of 80 healthcare providers.  These estimates are based on the assumption that each site will have the capacity to recruit 10 healthcare providers through their respective pediatric weight management clinics. In order to address potential difficulties with recruiting providers who are limited on time, we will be attempting to offer CME and/or MOC certification for participation.	37	Inclusion Criteria: Employed as a health provider at the institution as either a Physician, Physician Assistant, Nurse Practitioner, Nurse, Health Educator, and/or Registered Dietician; Currently working with pediatric youth ages 11-18 with obesity and weight management; ability to participate in both assessment and training activities; and English speaking.    Exclusion criteria: providers who are unable to attend the majority of the live trainings (4) and do not have time in their schedule to participate; non-English speaking.	\N	There will be three primary outcomes examined that will determine project success.    Outcome 1:  The primary outcome to be measured is the feasibility and acceptability of the training for providers.  Acceptability will be determined by providers attending at least 80% of the training sessions.  Feasibility will be determined by providers completing a ME knowledge questionnaire with a pass rate of at least 80% on the concepts within and behind ME to be indicative of adequate learning.    Outcome 2:  Participant acceptability will also be assessed through weekly evaluation forms ascertaining subjective competency levels, self-efficacy for teaching ME, benefits of learning ME, and effectiveness of training method after each training session.  This feedback with assist with evaluation of participant competency and adherence to the training which will allow for training refinement and revision of the manual.    Outcome 3: A three month post-training evaluation will be conducted on healthcare provider use of ME with overweight and obese youth in their clinics that examines: a) their perceived ability to integrate ME skills with their patients (i.e. how often and with how many patients), b) perceived barriers/facilitators to teaching ME, and c) perceived patient acceptance of learning ME skills.  We anticipate a completion rate of at least 80% of the participants.

Each healthcare provider participant will be asked to fill out demographics questionnaire, a pre-post training knowledge questionnaire, and a 3-month follow-up survey.  The demographic questionnaire will include the following provider information: discipline, years in practice, percentage of time spent working in a pediatric obesity management clinic(s), number of youth seen each year, and percentage of youth who are seen multiple times throughout the year for weight management.  In addition, each provider will be asked about prior mindfulness and ME training and to identify any ME domains, themes and/or practices that are currently part of the standard of care implemented within the pediatric weight management programs at their respective institution.  Interest level in acquiring standardized ME skills will also be obtained.      The pre-post online training survey will be filled out within the 2 weeks prior to training and within 2 weeks post training.  This survey will assess knowledge, awareness, and attitudes regarding the use of ME skills with pediatric populations.  For the knowledge component, we will determine a pass rate of at least 80% on the concepts within and behind ME to be indicative of adequate learning.  In order to facilitate learning of the material, any provider who falls below the 80% pass rate will be asked to view any relevant training sessions again, consult the training manual, discuss concepts with trainer Dr. Dalen, and retake the knowledge questionnaire.     Providers will be asked to attend 6-1� hour live telehealth group sessions to provide a platform from which providers can explore and practice core aspects of ME.  Each telehealth session will be videotaped for future access and viewing in case a provider has to miss a live session due to scheduling constraints. Before the end of each training session, providers will be asked to answer a few brief evaluation questions to ascertain provider's subjective competency levels, self-efficacy (i.e., confidence) for teaching ME, benefits of learning that session's ME content, and effectiveness of training method after each training session.    After training, heath providers will then complete a three month post-training evaluation on their subjective use of ME with overweight and obese youth in their clinics that examines: a) their perceived ability to integrate ME skills with their patients (i.e. how often and with how many patients), b) perceived barriers/facilitators to teaching ME, and c) perceived patient acceptance of learning ME skills.

CTSC Biostatisticians will assist with data analysis.    Sample Size Justification. 80 healthcare providers will be recruited. Sample size considerations are based on optimal positioning for future larger multisite studies and based on the following assumptions: 1) ability to develop a power analysis based on AIM 2 feasibility outcome; healthcare provider knowledge test with a pass rate of at least 80% on essential therapeutic elements. Analysis goal will be to determine with at least 0.90 power utilizing a T-test to determine the change score necessary to detect adequate power for a future study (see table 1 in appendex); 2) a larger sample will allow for secondary exploratory analyses utilizing ANOVA at a power of at least 0.80 to examine (a) differences in knowledge change score by region, and (b) differences in knowledge change score by type of provider (see table 2 in appendex); and (c) allows for attrition between and within sites; we estimate that a sample size between 50-80 will be sufficient for pilot study goals.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Not applicable.	\N	\N	\N	f	Each site will identify the key primary care clinics and multidisciplinary healthcare providers at their respective institutions who will participate in the training (both rural and urban) based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Participants will be told that participation is 100% voluntary and that by signing the consent/assent form they are not waiving their rights to terminate participation at any time during the study if they so choose.    Signed consent will consist of an electronic signature and the participant hitting an 'I agree' button.  The consent form will be set up in Redcap and will be directly imported into a password protected database.  RA's will print out the signed consent form and keep the hard copy in a location separate from the data. There will be no links between the consent form with identifiable information and the survey database.      Once potential participants are identified and agree to hear more information about the study, an RA will send out a link to a secure site where they are walked through the essential elements of informed consent. Participants will only get this link by first phoning an RA to go through a screening interview to determine eligibility. The RA will email or text them the link to consent for the study.    Projected Timelines. 1) Enrollment of participants will take place in study months 1-5; 2) Mindful eating training for participants will take place in study months 5-8, and 3) Post-Training Evaluation to be completed by participants in study months 11-12. The amount of time it will take for each health provider's participation is as follows: (1) Attendance at the 6 � hours of online trainings, which will also include 2 hours of individual homework following each training, (2) Completion of an on-line assessment battery consisting of a demographics questionnaire, a pre and post training questionnaire estimated to take approximately 1 hour each, and a 1 hour 3 month follow-up questionnaire.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mindful Eating Training. Providers will be asked to attend 6-1� hour live telehealth group sessions to provide a platform from which providers can explore and practice core aspects of ME.  Each telehealth session will be videotaped for future access and viewing in case a provider has to miss a live session due to scheduling constraints. Each session is designed to be highly interactive and experiential and will consist of both didactic information and ME-awareness exercises that can be directly taught to youth. Content will consist of core components of professional ME training curricula adapted for use with healthcare providers, who may not have been previously exposed to the concepts of mindfulness.  Standardized handouts and materials that can be printed out and used with youth in a primary care setting will be included.  Approximately two hours of homework will be given each week, which will typically consist of reading the training manual, and practicing mindful eating awareness techniques for themselves.  Before the end of each training session, providers will be asked to answer a few brief evaluation questions to ascertain provider's subjective competency levels, self-efficacy (i.e., confidence) for teaching ME, benefits of learning that session's ME content, and effectiveness of training method after each training session.	2	76	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	8	\N	1	\N	Aim 1.A. Test the effectiveness of a 6-week mindful eating (ME) training curriculum delivered via telehealth for healthcare provider use with pediatric obesity and weight management populations. The curriculum will be tailored to the education needs of pediatric healthcare providers, suitable for use in applied community settings, and demonstrate feasibility and acceptability. Hypothesis: participants will be able to pass a knowledge test evaluating their grasp of the concepts within and behind ME with a pass rate of at least 80% to essential therapeutic elements. Program will show acceptability by participants attending at least 80% of the training sessions.        Aim1.B. Secondary exploratory analyses includes (a) differences in knowledge change score by region, and (b) differences in     knowledge change score by type of provider.  In addition, participant feedback will be assessed through weekly evaluation forms     ascertaining subjective competency levels, self-efficacy for teaching ME, benefits of learning ME, and effectiveness of training     method after each training session.  All provider feedback will be gathered and outcomes related to competency and adherence     will be evaluated.  Any deficits will be addressed through program and training refinement and the manual will be revised     accordingly.    Aim 2: To assess ME curriculum use and integration within the healthcare provider's primary care setting.  Specifically, participants will complete a three month post-training evaluation on their use of ME with overweight and obese youth in their clinics that examines: a) their perceived ability to integrate ME skills with their patients (i.e. how often and with how many patients), b) perceived barriers/facilitators to teaching ME, and c) perceived patient acceptance of learning ME skills.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	80	\N	\N

I have conducted two prior single-site studies of this nature in the colonoscopy suite at Tufts Medical Center quite successfully, resulting in three published studies and one abstract (1.   Kim YI, et al. Am J Gastroenterol. 2001;96: 184-95; 2.  Kim YI, et al. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2001;10: 715-9.; 3.   Kim YI, et al. Am J Clin Nutr 1998;68: 866-72.; 4.    Pfalzer A, et al.  FASEB J 2014;28 (suppl 1): 136.6[abstr]).  The most recent of the two prior studies recruited a mean of 6 subjects per month.  Since our sample size estimates indicate that we will require 90 subjects (see statistics section), we project it will take 5-6 months to recruit the necessary number of individuals.    The biggest anticipated obstacle will be the reluctance of prospective subjects to enroll when the study will require an additional limited colonoscopy four weeks after the first procedure.  We will provide an IRB-designated amount of stipend for each participant, which will encourage (but not unduly coerce) participation. The appropariate handling of the biopsies after they are obtained will be imporant, and we feel that since there will be only 3 study sites we will have the opportunity to be highly selective, ensuring that each site has suitable personnel that have both the experience and diligence that will be needed.	42	We will enroll 90 obese subjects (BMI > 30). Patients aged 45-75 yrs who are scheduled to undergo routine screening colonoscopy in the Tufts Medical Center Endoscopy Suite and two other sites will be asked to participate. Recruitment will be conducted in a way to ensure that the proportion of genders within the two groups remain within 10% of each other. Patients will be considered ineligible if they have a current or previous cancer within the last 5 years (except basal cell cancer, superficial skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix), a history of inflammatory bowel disease, polyposis, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs >1X/week, oral corticosteroids or any other drugs considered by the investigators to likely to alter the inflammatory response.	\N	The primary endpoint will be the measure of colonic IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha (other pro-inflammatory cytokines will also be measured as a matter of completeness). These analytes will be measured by a multiplex chemiluminescence platform that we have, and which was used successfully to measure human colonic cytokines in our prior clinical study.

Patients aged 45-75 yrs scheduled to undergo routine screening colonoscopy will be asked to participate. Recruitment will be conducted in a way to ensure that the proportion of genders within the two groups remain within 10% of each other. Patients will be considered ineligible if they have a current or previous cancer within the last 5 years (except basal cell cancer, superficial skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix), a history of inflammatory bowel disease, polyposis, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs >1X/week, oral corticosteroids or any other drugs considered by the investigators to likely to alter the inflammatory response.    Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive either two placebo tablets daily, or a 4 gram capsule of curcumin and 3.5 gram tablet of salsalate.    Twenty mLs of blood will be drawn before the colonoscopy for measurement of serum TNF-?, IL-1? and IL-6: these blood analytes constitute secondary endpoints.Weight, height, and waist and hip circumference of the subjects will also be measured immediately prior to colonoscopy.    Subjects will undergo routine colonoscopy, adenomas and other polyps will be removed per the usual clinical routine. We will record the number, size, and histological grade of all polyps, as well as any other pathologies.  Subjects will have 8 additional biopsies performed of the rectosigmoid junction, no closer than 10 cms to any polyp.  Collection of colonic biopsies is routine and in the four prior studies conducted by my research team in the colonoscopy suite, involving a total of over 140 subjects, and there has never been an adverse event.  Six of the biopsies will be placed immediately into a foil placket that is then inserted into a cryotube and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Colonic TNF-?, IL-1?, IL-6, and IF? concentrations, expressed in ng/mg mucosal protein, will be determined by our multiplex chemiluminescence platform and western blots will be used to quantitate cellular proteins indicative of NFkB and ERK 1/2 signaling. Each of the two remaining biopsies will be placed on a small piece of filter paper, oriented under a dissecting microscope located in the colonoscopy suite so the luminal surface of the mucosa is facing upwards, and fixed in buffered formalin.  Histology slides will be prepared, and quantitative immunohistochemistry will be used to assess Ki-67 and activated caspase-3, validated metrics of proliferation and apoptosis, respectively.     Four weeks later, after undergoing an identical colonic lavage preparation, each subject will undergo a colonoscopy limited to the rectosigmoid, at which time 8 biopsies will be obtained for the same endpoints.	\N	\N	630	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sample size estimates: Observations from our recent human study indicate the mean concentration of IL-1? in the colon of obese patients is 1.2 pg/mg protein, as compared to 0.65 in the lean group. Group sample sizes of 40 in each arm will achieve 80% power to detect a difference of 0.4 pg/mg between groups, assuming a mean of 1.2 pg/mg in the control group and that the mean of the intervention group is 0.8 with estimated group standard deviations of 0.8 and 0.3, and a significance level of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample t-test. Our preliminary data generated the above estimates of standard deviations in each group, and supports our detectable effect size. We plan to recruit 90 people in total, with equal allocation between the two treatment groups since this will accommodate a 5-10% loss to follow-up. Our sample size allows us to estimate an effect of curcumin/salsalate that is approximately two thirds of the size of the difference between mean IL1 beta levels in lean vs. obese human subjects.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	No conflicts to declare	\N	\N	\N	\N	A clinical trial coordinator, whose FTE effort will be no less than 40% on this trial, will be hired for each of the three study sites.  This coordinator will examine the colonoscopy schedule a few weeks in advance and telephone individuals who are likely candidates for the study.  The study will be briefly introduced and the coordinator will ask 2-3 questions to ensure that the prospective candidate meets the eligibility criteria.  If the prospect remains interested they will be met by the coordinator or P.I. on the morning of the colonoscopy.  At this time the study will be presented in detail and written consent will be obtained.  As mentioned in an earlier section, in our most recent study we were able to recruit six such obese subjects each month in the colonoscopy suite at Tufts Medical Center, which conducts about 25 colonoscopies per week.  With three sites actively recruiting, the study enrollment should be completed in 5-6 months.       The coordinator will accompany the subject into the colonoscopy suite, arrange for the blood sample with the endoscopy nurses, and remain during the endoscopy in order to receive and process the biopsies.      Two weeks into the intervention the coordinator will telephone subjects to monitor for any side effects of the intervention and to encourage compliance.  At the four week mark the coordinator will once again meet the subject in the colonoscopy suite to repeat sample collection.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive either two placebo tablets daily, or a 4 gram capsule of curcumin and 3.5 gram tablet of salsalate.  After a 30 day intervention, this dose of curcumin was observed to produce a 40% decrease in colonic aberrant crypt foci among 19 human cigarette smokers (1).  Clinical trials with the same doses of these two agents have demonstrated few adverse effects.  No subject in the abovementioned curucmin trial (1) discontinued the curcumin due to adverse effects: the only grade 3 toxic event (i.e.: requiring hospitalization) was atypical chest pain, which was determined to be unrelated to the curcumin.  The grade 1 ('no or mild symptoms; no interventions required') and grade 2 ('minimal intervention indicated') events largely consisted of mild diarrhea.  In a 1 year placebo-controlled trial the abovementioned dose of salsalate was administered to 146 obese diabetics, who experienced significant decreases in systemic measures of inflammation and a significant improvement in blood glucose (2).  No serious adverse events were observed, including no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.  A very small but statistically significant increase in mean serum creatinine occurred in the salsalate group (0.02 mg/dL), which was significantly different than the placebo group, but neither the cystatin C or estimated GFR changed significantly.         1.

Further, by comparing the colonic transcriptome from obese and leans subjects we have observed changes in gene expression that are indicative of activation of the NFkB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.  Activation of NFkB is thought to play a direct role in the molecular carcinogenesis of most colorectal cancers and ERK1/2 is an activator of ras, which is also thought to be integral in the evolution of colorectal cancer. We propose to conduct a Phase II placebo-controlled clinical trial that is designed to answer the following aims:    1) Determine if daily administration of the combination of curcumin and salsalate over 4 weeks diminishes the concentration of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in the colons of obese subjects undergoing routine screening colonoscopy, reduces valid measures of NFkB and ERK1/2 signaling, and alters metrics of epithelial proliferation and apoptosis in an anti-cancer direction.    2) Determine the incidence and define the nature of any side effects experienced by study subjects due to the co-administration of curcumin and salsalate.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	90	\N	\N

Biochemical measures will include periodic measurement of plasma amino acids including phenylalanine and the other aromatic amino acids and for biopterin defects and DNAJC12 deficiency measurement of biopterin concentration and monoamine neurotransmitters in CSF. Additionally, we will perform periodic neurocognitive and behavioral assessments using specific instruments from the NIH Toolbox, administer a PKU-specific Quality of Life tool, and a patient reported outcomes questionnaire (PROMIS). We are also planning, for adolescents and adults, DEXA scanning to measure body composition and bone density. All of this data will be uploaded into a remote database to be developed with the NIH-funded Data Management Coordinating Center (DMCC).

Of these, we anticipate 65,000 women will join the randomized cohort.   Our overall study population from the California centers is comprised of approximately 36% white, 7% black, 17% Asian-American, 36% Latino and 4% are 2 or more categories88. Few geographic locations other than California contain such population diversity. The Native American population in the Sanford Health (Midwest) region ranges from 2.7% or 21% of the population depending on the county (the national average is about 1.2%).  4.1 Anticipated Number of Research Subjects  To date, 100,000 women have enrolled in the Athena screening and risk assessment program, with over 6000 new participants enrolling each month.  The full trial will recruit approximately 100,000 women, 65,000 of whom we anticipate will participate in the randomized cohort. We anticipate an increased referral rate to Athena due to designation as the preferred provider for UC Care, the new self-insured University of California health plan (50,000+ UC employees and their dependents and growing). Also, the Sanford Health Network in North/South Dakota has recently joined Athena, and will be a recruiting site from the start of the study.  The full study will recruit from those that are already in Athena, as well as new participants who are referred to the study through their health care provider, or community and media outreach efforts.	42	4.2 Inclusion Criteria   a)\tFemale  b)\tAge 40 years to 74 years old  c)\tPrior mammogram within the last 2 years (BIRADS 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4), or mammogram completed upon joining the study   d)\tCoverage by a participating insurer  e)\tReceive breast screening at an Athena site (UCSF, UCSD, UCD, UCLA, UCI, Sanford: for the first phase of the study); expansion to other medical care providers in phase 2  4.3 Exclusion Criteria  a)\tPrior Breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosis  b)\tInability to provide consent   c)\tNon-English proficiency (plans to expand to Spanish by year 2)	\N	6.1 Outcomes  \t6.1.1 Primary Outcomes    The primary objective of this study is to determine whether personalized screening can prevent at least as many late-stage cancers as annual screening while requiring fewer biopsies. Therefore, this study has two co-primary endpoints, one to quantify safety and one to quantify morbidity.  Safety is measured by the rate of cancers diagnosed at stage IIB or higher. Morbidity is measured by the rate of breast biopsy. This trial will be considered a success if the risk based screening approach is found to be non-inferior to the annual screening approach in terms of safety and superior to the annual screening approach in terms of morbidity.      \t6.1.2 Secondary Outcomes  •\tRate of stage IIB and interval cancers (see glossary)  •\tRates of systemic therapy  •\tRecall rates and follow-up procedures  •\tRates of DCIS  •\tRates of chemoprevention   •\tProportion of women who agree to enroll into the study that choose risk based versus annual screening in the self-assigned cohort versus opting to be randomized  •\tAdherence to the assigned screening schedule in the randomized cohort  •\tPROMIS anxiety score  •\tBreast Cancer Risk Worry	6 medical centers are participating in the WISDOM study: UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego, UC San Francisco, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and Stanford Medical Health Centers (across Midwest region)	\N	\N	\N	\N	5 years (expected additional funding possibly)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	This study is a pragmatic, preference-tolerant randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the safety and morbidity of risk based screening versus an annual screening strategy.

Women who consent to randomization will be enrolled and randomized equally between the two arms- annual screening and risk-based screening.  Randomization will be stratified by site [UCSF, UCI, UCLA, UCD, UCSD, Sanford, virtual site] and Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium risk score (3 categories) to ensure similar population distributions in the two arms.  All participants in the annual screening arm will be assigned an annual screening schedule unless they are identified as being at highest risk according to the BCSC model or previously known genetic factors (see Section 5.2.2). Those identified as being at highest risk in the annual screening arm will follow standard of care that may include more frequent screening.  All participants in the risk-based screening arm will be assigned a screening schedule according to their risk assessment.	\N	\N	292	\N	\N	84	\N	\N	The primary objective of this study is to determine whether personalized screening can prevent at least as many late-stage cancers as annual screening while requiring fewer biopsies. Therefore, this study has two co-primary endpoints, one to quantify safety and one to quantify morbidity.  Safety is measured by the rate of cancers diagnosed at stage IIB or higher. Morbidity is measured by the rate of breast biopsy. This trial will be considered a success if the risk based screening approach is found to be non-inferior to the annual screening approach in terms of safety and superior to the annual screening approach in terms of morbidity.    Women who consent to be randomized will be randomized 1:1 to either annual screening or a risk based screening recommendation.  Randomization will be stratified by site and risk strata as determined by the BCSC model.	\N	\N	\N	\N	5	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	64	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The study is currently in its third year (out of 5) of funding however most recruitment started in year 2.

For Aim 1, children presenting to one of the PECARN Registry sites with a sickle cell VOC and all data will be submitted as part of the already IRB approved PECARN Registry project. Data from 2016 through the start date of the project will be utilized as baseline data. Data will continue to be tracked through the two-year project.

This task is meant to be done as observation only with minimal distractions to the clinicians. Notes will be taken by the RC regarding work arounds or skips in different steps in the guideline. After the observation, the RC will complete the BIM to document their findings. RCs will also discuss the barriers and facilitators with ED providers at each site using the BIM as a tool to guideline adherence. Lastly, we will ask an ED provider at each site to note any barriers or facilitators to providing this care in the ED setting as they walk through the process in real time clinical care. RCs will also survey five patient/parent pairs at each site at the end of an ED visit for SCD pain to determine their perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to guideline adherent ED care from the patient perspective.

Of these patients, there are approximately 2,600 visits to the ED per year by 1,200 children for acute painful VOC.

As noted above, we will identify high and low performer sites and those that fit in between. For Aim 1a, the mean time to opioid for encounters in a particular calendar month will be provided as a graphical representation. For Aim 1b, we will determine the proportion of hospital encounters in which eligible patients had hydroxyurea as an active medication at admission to the ED and at discharge from a hospitalization. We will examine the trends in the data over the time frame and account for any contextual changes that may have been introduced into the care of these patients at these sites. For example, at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin site we began using IN fentanyl in the ED in the year 2017 and expect the trend data in timeliness will reflect this practice change.   At the completion of Aims 1a and 1b, we will have measured the baseline adherence to the NHLBI SCD-specific guidelines related to the ED care of pain and the use of hydroxyurea in patients in whom pain has resulted in hospitalization, and thus significantly affected their quality of life. We will also have established trends in data over that time and noted any interventions that have already occurred and the varied effects those interventions may have had at different sites.     For aim 2, The PIs will interview the ED and hematology co-investigators to get feedback and input on the content and presentation of the data in the performance report card to improve it for use as an implementation strategy in the future hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial. The audit and feedback (A&F) process will be informed by review of the literature and examination of current PECARN dashboards for other diseases to determine the best way to provide feedback for the future implementation trial. For example, with our access to the PECARN Registry, we are well positioned to implement A&F strategies to support changes in practitioners' behavior.  As recommended, we will ensure that we tie our strategies with theoretical justification so they can be testable. Moreover, the effectiveness of A&F has been shown to be variable probably because of the many variations of the process: one can vary the timing of delivery, the format of the feedback (verbal or written) or content (positive or negative). To diminish the variability of delivery of A&F, our plan is to use a fidelity framework to guide and evaluate the design, training of providers, delivery of the feedback, and target audience of our study.  Additionally, we will use the components of behavior change techniques (BCTs) to ensure that the intervention components, theoretical underpinnings and the key assumptions are clearly articulated.	\N	\N	\N	\N	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	16	No financial ties or other conflicts of interest are present.	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	This is a mixed methods study evaluating the treatment of children with SCD presenting with acute painful VOC.

Heart failure need not be the reason for hospitalization. Participants will not be excluded on the basis of race or ethnicity and the diversity of the sample is expected to reflect US heart failure incidence rates.   Enrolling sites will also be selected, in part, based on their demographic profile. The enrolling centers will be regionally dispersed throughout rural and urban areas with a broad distribution of racial and ethnic representation expected to provide a balanced demographic distribution of traditionally underrepresented minorities. While the investigative team has led HF trials with robust enrollment of African Americans (30% of the HF-ACTION cohort),57 we have incorporated additional strategies to improve the enrollment of underrepresented minorities for targeted enrollment of 35%. By systematically identifying eligible patients during hospitalization (rather than outpatient clinic visits) and having no site-dependent follow-up visits, the proposed study conduct will reduce bias against the enrollment and retention of disadvantaged groups. By including HFpEF patients, who are more often female, the entry criteria will also support balanced enrollment by sex	19	Inclusion Criteria  1)\t≥ 18 years of age  2)\tPatient with heart failure who is hospitalized  3)\tOutpatient plans for an oral loop diuretic regimen  4)\tSigned informed consent    Exclusion Criteria  1)\tEnd-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy  2)\tInability or unwillingness to comply with the study requirements  3)\tHistory of heart transplant or actively listed for heart transplant  4)\tPregnant or nursing women  5)\tMalignancy or other non-cardiac condition limiting life expectancy to <12 months  6)\tKnown hypersensitivity to furosemide, torsemide, or related agents	\N	Primary Endpoint   The primary endpoint of this study will be all-cause mortality at 12 months.

Crossovers will be tracked by the call center at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months and we will have an alternate analysis cohort based on these data.   The statistical comparison of the two randomized arms with respect to the primary endpoint will be a time-to-event analysis, and therefore will be based on the time from randomization to mortality. The Cox proportional hazards regression model will be the primary tool to analyze and assess outcome differences between the two treatment arms. A hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for summarizing the difference in outcomes between the two treatment arms will be computed using the Cox model.   Sample Size-   Based on previous data in similar populations, we anticipate a 20% mortality rate in the furosemide group at 12-months following randomization. A sample size of 6000 subjects will provide approximately 85% power to detect a 15% relative reduction in the primary endpoint with torsemide (3% absolute difference). This sample size will also provide excellent power for the secondary endpoints.   Analysis of Secondary Endpoints-   The analyses for the time-to-event secondary endpoints will be similar to those outlined for the primary endpoint using the time from randomization through the first occurrence of any component of a specific secondary endpoint (or censoring) as the response variable, and assessing group differences using the Cox proportional hazards model.	\N	\N	\N	\N	11	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	9	None.	t	\N	\N	\N	First site initiation date is projected in mid-Feb, 2018.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of serial amnioinfusion to reliably prevent pulmonary hypoplasia in patients with isolated CoBRA. It is unknown if serial amnioinfusions can reliably prevent pulmonary hypoplasia in the setting of CoBRA.  Similarly, it is not known if serial amnioinfusions will give neonates enough pulmonary reserve to be candidates for renal replacement therapy with acceptable levels of morbidity. We hypothesize that serial amnioinfusions of normal saline will reliably prevent lethal pulmonary hypoplasia in fetuses diagnosed with CoBRA with minimal maternal morbidity.  Furthermore, we hypothesize that greater than 50% of treated patients will be candidates for dialysis and eventual transplant. This research is of critical importance to determine the efficacy of RAFT and provide guidance for patients and physicians dealing with CoBRA. We will test these hypotheses in the following specific aims; we aim 1) to determine the maternal safety and feasibility serial amnioinfusions in CoBRA 2) to determine the efficacy of serial amnioinfusions to rescue neonatal lung function and 3) to determine the quality of life for patients and families in which the RAFT is successful    We propose to establish a prospective cohort multi-center study ofl patients who carry a fetus with isolated CoBRA including women who decline termination and elect expectant or invasive treatment. Within this cohort we will apply strict criteria for intervention that are based on standardized accepted criteria.  By applying uniform prospective case, characterization to all patients we will be able to uncover information that is generalizable to this population. We will evaluate maternal safety and feasibility of serial amnioinfusions for RAFT. Furthermore, we will determine the efficacy of serial amnioinfusion in preventing lethal pulmonary hypoplasia in these infants.  We will also establish a baseline natural history for untreated CoBRA patients.  We plan to recruit 60 mother/fetus pairs into the trial.      Enrollment Criteria  Enrollment in the study will require confirmation of an isolated CoBRA diagnosis and confirmation that the participant does not wish to undergo termination. This diagnosis can be made as early as 16 weeks gestation age (GA) when amniotic fluid is no longer derived from a maternal transplacental source but rather from fetal urine production.  After a patient is referred to one of our study centers, the diagnosis of isolated CoBRA will be confirmed in the following way:     1)\tAnhydramnios in the absence of ruptured membranes on                ultrasound imaging   2)\tNo demonstrated kidneys on grey scale on ultrasound               imaging   3)\tNo demonstrated renal vessels on color Doppler, B flow                 and power Doppler imaging   4)\tNo visualized bladder filling on ultrasound imaging     As part of routine care the mother will undergo a diagnostic amnioinfusion at this stage to enable a detailed sonographic fetal evaluation to look for extra-renal anomalies. Other significant anomalies will make the patient ineligible for enrollment. Approximately one week after this visit, the mother will return per routine for a follow-up ultrasound.  Confirmation of the diagnosis will be made by complete loss of infused fluid without rupture of membranes and again demonstration of diagnostic criteria 2-4.  After confirmation of the diagnosis, the following inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied to the candidates:      Inclusion criteria:   1)\tConfirmed diagnosis of isolated bilateral renal agenesis as outlined in study procedures  2)\tConfirmation that the expectant mother does not wish to undergo termination of pregnancy    3)\tNormal karyotype, and any comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) if performed   4)\tAge greater than 18 for expectant mothers  5)\tWillingness to be followed and deliver at study center  6)\tWillingness for postnatal care to be performed at study center  7)\tWillingness to have a child in the study until four year after transplantation  8)\tCompleted consults with pediatric nephrology, neonatology, transplant surgery, pediatric surgery, social worker and maternal fetal medicine     Exclusion criteria:  1)\tCervix less than 2.5 cm in length  2)\tEvidence of chorioamnionitis  3)\tEvidence of rupture of membranes or chorioamniotic separation  4)\tEvidence of preterm labor  5)\tMultiple gestation pregnancy  6)\tSevere maternal medical condition in pregnancy.  7)\tMaternal depression as assessed by a Beck Depression Inventory score equal to or greater than 17  8)\tTechnical limitations precluding amnioinfusion    Intervention Arm  For those patients who are eligible and wish to join the study, the options of expectant management or serial amnioinfusions will be offered.  Counseling provided by pediatric nephrologists, surgeons, transplant surgeons, urologists, social workers, and maternal fetal medicine specialists will take place in a nondirective and supportive environment.  After counseling, patients who are greater than 20 weeks GA but less than 26 weeks GA who wish to continue the pregnancy and undergo intervention will be eligible for intervention; they will return every 7-9 days for amnioinfusions with normal saline until 32 weeks GA. After 32 weeks GA, the fetal therapist will determine the risk/benefit ratio of further infusions in light of the likelihood of inducing preterm labor. The amnioinfusion will be performed under local anesthesia with a 22 or 20 gauged needle as guided by the clinical picture.  The maximal flow rates will be dependent on needle gauge and may take up to one hour.  The volume of the infusate will go up gradually with the size of the fetus. Previous trials that have involved the use of serial amnioinfusion have infused up to 1.5 liters of fluid if it was tolerated in order to minimize the number of procedures.15  Larger volume infusions decrease the need for more frequent infusions and also increase the probability of residual fluid being present at the next opportunity for amnioinfusion.  This residual fluid provides a target and makes amnioinfusion easier.  We plan to utilize this same strategy and will aim for a deepest vertical pocket of 10 after each infusion.  Each amnioinfusion has an approximately 1-2% rate of premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM).  Importantly, emnrolled mothers may withdraw from the intervention arm (or the study entirely) at any time.     Expectant Management Arm  Those participants who, after the counseling offered above, wish to continue the pregnancy but do not wish to undergo intervention will undergo ultrasounds and monitoring every 1-2 weeks. They will also receive standard of care maternal steroid therapy.     Postnatal Care  Routine postnatal care for both groups will occur in the delivery room and NICU including ventilator support for patients who opt for and against RAFT.  Viability of the neonate after birth will not be determined by study team members, but rather by the independent neonatal team. Dialysis will be initiated or withheld per established NICU and nephrology guidelines for dialysis in the setting of respiratory support. We plan to follow surviving fetuses until four years of age after they have undergone kidney transplantation.  All newborns will be enrolled National American Pediatric Renal Trial Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) registry.        Data Collection  Prenatal: Biometric data will be collected on each mother/fetus pair at every prenatal ultrasound visit.  These data will include the amniotic fluid index (AFI), deepest vertical pocket (DVP), cervix length, estimated fetal weight, umbilical artery and vein waveforms. For patients undergoing RAFT additional data will be collected for each procedure including length of procedure, amount of fluid infused, rate of fluid infusion, adverse events during infusion, post-procedure AFI, DVP and cervical length. An intrauterine fetal demise will be recorded. In order to test the hypothesis in Aim 1, major and minor complications will be recorded.  Major complications be defined as fetal death, prematurity < 30 weeks GA, chorioamnionitis, placental abruption, maternal bleeding requiring a blood transfusion, and uterine rupture.  Minor complications will be defined as local wound infection requiring antibiotics, narcotic pain treatment for > 1 day, fetal injury and amniotic band syndrome    Perinatal: Gestational age at delivery, delivery mode, Apgars, and umbilical cord blood gases will be recorded.      Early Postnatal:  First arterial blood gas, ventilator support and settings, and use of nitric oxide will be recorded.  Procedures to initiate dialysis and their success will be recorded (peritoneal or hemo). Episodes of sepsis will be recorded as defined by blood culture positivity. Episodes of peritonitis will also be defined as antibiotics started for an intra-abdominal infection. Need for a gastrostomy tube, tunneled central line and tracheostomy will be recorded. Neurologic injury or dysfunction will be recorded. Medications at discharge, respiratory support at discharge and nutritional support at discharge will be recorded.  Death before discharge will be recorded. Age and weight at discharge will be recorded. Discharge to home or another facility will be noted.      Post-discharge follow-up: In order to follow the outcomes of these patients in the long-term, we plan to use the infrastructure and data gathering mechanisms of the NAPRTCS registry.  This registry is an ongoing research effort that began in 1987 and includes follow-up on over 20,000 patients.  Greater than 500 pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease, dialysis and renal transplant join the registry each year. There are over 60 active NAPRTCS centers and 100 centers that have data sharing agreements--all of these centers have established protocols for capturing data from pediatric patients with renal failure.  We will ensure that upon discharge all of our patients are offered enrollment in NAPRTCS and arrange for the follow-up to take place at a NAPRTCS center.  NAPRTCS uses an electronic data capture system that allows data to be securely entered and retrieved on the internet.  Validated electronic data forms for each patient visit have been developed.  There are data forms for entry into the registry, each dialysis visit, transplant and follow-up after transplant.  Patient demographic data will be entered at the patient's first outpatient encounter through the entry into the registry form.  This data will include age, race, gender, insurance coverage, maternal and paternal education level, blood type, type of dialysis, and initial dialysis access. Data points collected at each visit include current type of dialysis access, access complications, adverse event reporting including need for hospitalization or new medication, and use of growth hormone. Transplant data forms record date and age of transplant, living versus cadaveric donors, HLA histocompatibility, immunsuppressive regimen, calcineurin trough levels, sirolimus trough levels, concominant drug therapy, days of hospitalization, education level,  graft failure, acute rejection, chronic rejection, renal artery stenosis, infection, malignancy, prior transplants, days of hospitalization, echocardiogram, immunosuppression toxicity, compliance with medications, death from other causes, loss to follow-up. Sample data forms are included in the appendix.  Additional data that will be added to the NAPRTCS forms will be needed for urinary tract reconstruction, number of urinary tract operations, kind of urinary tract reconstruction, urinary continence, need for catheterization, and urostomy.  \tIn order to evaluate quality of life of CoBRA survivors the validated PEDS QLTM measurement model for the pediatric quality of life inventory will be performed at 3 months intervals for each patient at their follow-up visit in concert with NAPRTCS data acquisition. PEDS QLTM instrument is the premier multilingual tool for assessing quality of life in pediatric patients with chronic disease.16  It takes 4 minutes to administer and has excellent reliability and flexibility. This tool is already being administered by NAPRTCS to all chronic renal failure patients.  We have already arranged to create a contemporaneous control group from within the NAPRTCS registry of patients with neonatal renal failure requiring neonatal dialysis for reasons other than CoBRA as a control group.   Similarly, the Parent Stress Inventory, 4th Ed will be administered to the primary caregivers of the patient at follow-up visits.  This instrument is well validated and has been used for caregivers of pediatric patients with severe and chronic medical conditions between 1 month and 12 years of age.17  It takes 20 minutes to administer and we have made arrangements with NAPRTCS to begin administering it to the caregivers of all patients with neonatal renal failure requiring neonatal dialysis.  We will, thus, be able to compare the scores of CoBRA and non-CoBRA patients.	\N	\N	335	\N	\N	93	\N	\N	Although our experience suggests that there will be an approximately 50% split between those parents eligible for the study that elect RAFT vs. expectant management, we must prepare for an unequal distribution of patients between arms.  We therefore used a two sided Fisher's Exact test to show the power that would be achieved with a total sample size of 60 mother/fetus pairs with variable size of the RAFT and expectant management group.  We ran this analysis 4 times with combinations of RAFT survival to dialysis of 50% and 75% and expectant management survival of 5% and 2%..  With a RAFT survival to dialysis of 50% and expectant management survival to dialysis of 5% a near even distribution of patient in the two arms is required to obtain a power of 80%.  Much more uneven distributions yield a power of greater than 80% in all the other projected survival groups.  We, therefore believe the study is appropriately powered because survival in the expectant management group is expected to be near zero.	\N	\N	\N	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	15	\N	t	\N	\N	t	\N	The JHU-Tufts TIC and the Vanderbilt RIC conducted an initial consult for Dr. Jelin's study, The Renal Agenesis Fetal Therapy (RAFT) Trial. Congenital Bilateral Renal Agenesis (CoBRA) has long been thought to be incompatible with life because of neonatal respiratory and renal failure.  Case reports have suggested that serial amnioinfusions can rescue lung function and large series have demonstrated that neonatal dialysis and pediatric kidney transplant are viable strategies for neonatal renal failure. The goal of this trial is to determine whether serial amnioinfusions can reliably rescue postnatal lung function in fetuses diagnosed with CoBRA. The study hypothesis is that serial amnioinfusions of normal saline in patients with CoBRA is safe and feasible and that this therapy will reliably lead to successful postnatal dialysis and meaningful survival.	\N	\N	\N	For those patients who are eligible and wish to join the study, the options of expectant management or serial amnioinfusions will be offered.  Counseling provided by pediatric nephrologists, surgeons, transplant surgeons, urologists, social workers, and maternal fetal medicine specialists will take place in a nondirective and supportive environment.  After counseling, patients who are greater than 20 weeks GA but less than 26 weeks GA who wish to continue the pregnancy and undergo intervention will be eligible for intervention; they will return every 7-9 days for amnioinfusions with normal saline until 32 weeks GA. After 32 weeks GA, the fetal therapist will determine the risk/benefit ratio of further infusions in light of the likelihood of inducing preterm labor. The amnioinfusion will be performed under local anesthesia with a 22 or 20 gauged needle as guided by the clinical picture.  The maximal flow rates will be dependent on needle gauge and may take up to one hour.  The volume of the infusate will go up gradually with the size of the fetus. Previous trials that have involved the use of serial amnioinfusion have infused up to 1.5 liters of fluid if it was tolerated in order to minimize the number of procedures.15  Larger volume infusions decrease the need for more frequent infusions and also increase the probability of residual fluid being present at the next opportunity for amnioinfusion.  This residual fluid provides a target and makes amnioinfusion easier.  We plan to utilize this same strategy and will aim for a deepest vertical pocket of 10 after each infusion.  Each amnioinfusion has an approximately 1-2% rate of premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM).  Importantly, emnrolled mothers may withdraw from the intervention arm (or the study entirely) at any time	1	156	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	25	5	\N	2	\N	Our primary objectives are to determine the maternal safety and feasibility serial amnioinfusions in CoBRA 2) to determine the efficacy of serial amnioinfusions to rescue neonatal lung function.

Repeat measures showed a SD of delta Ave90Clr for two baselines of 6% with a mean baseline Ave90Clr of 20%. Using these values, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, a sample size of 12 subjects will allow us to detect an absolute difference in deltaAveClr90 of 5% or a 25% improvement in MCC/CC. This is one half the 50% improvement in MCC afforded by both 2-week administration of 7% hypertonic saline in CF patients and administration of aerosolized losartan in the sheep model after 3 day challenges with CFTRinh172+HNE. Thus, an n=16 (repeat measures of 4 patients/year) should provide sufficient power (0.90) to observe an improvement of MCC/CC with losartan treatment in our CF cohort if present, even if there will be dropouts.	48	Inclusion criteria  Total of 16 CF patients with any known mutation combination not on CFTR augmentation therapy (females and males)  ?18 years of age  Severity of the Disease: Suitable patients will have mild to moderate lung disease, as defined by:      FEV1 ?40% of predicted at the screening visit.

Secondary hypotheses: Losartan will  reduce nasal cytokine levels as well as systemic inflammatory markers and may improve lung function and quality of life.

Attached table illustrates the timeline.                                             Briefly, 16 patients with CF, >18 years of age, who are not on CFTR augmentation therapy will be recruited for this trial (4 per year). After signing informed consent at the screening visit, we will perform spirometry, take blood (see below), and test for pregnancy where applicable. Since losartan has teratogenic effects, we will enforce strict birth control in female participants. Eligible patients will complete visits as outlined in graph and table below.                                             Measurements: Quality of life will be assessed by CFQ-R (CF quality of life questionnaire - revised). Cytokines will be measured from nasal fluid collected by Leukosorb filter paper. After assessing baselines, a daily dose of 50 mg losartan will be started, followed by a safety visit 7 days after treatment start (� 2 days). Then, the losartan dose will be increased to 100 mg daily until week 14. Since this trial assesses anti-inflammatory effects of losartan, the total duration will be 14 weeks to achieve >12 weeks of treatment with losartan.	\N	\N	490	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Statistics:   For the formal analysis, mixed effects models will be used. We will determine the final analytic approach based on the final available data. Only cases with complete data will be included. For secondary endpoints, we will investigate the distributional properties of the defined outcome measures - such as FEV1, changes in inflammatory markers, etc. Necessary transformations will be applied to satisfy normality assumptions if necessary. Baseline values of all variables will be examined, and estimates of baseline means and changes over time will be provided. The statistical analysis will consist of descriptive statistics associated with outcome measure (mean change or mean difference pre and post treatment). Means at baseline, 7 and 13/14 weeks, for each outcome, as well as the change over time will be provided, and the corresponding estimates of variability and 95% confidence intervals will be constructed. However, the primary focus for this analysis is to obtain reliable estimates of the mean changes and variability, which will be useful for designing further investigation focused and specifically powered for comparing these outcomes. P-value will be significant if < 0.05. All tests will be two-tailed. The SAS statistical software package version 9.3 (Cary, NC) will be used for all statistical analyses.              Expected outcome:   Given our preliminary data, we do expect MCC/CC and at least QOL to improve. Other secondary outcomes may improve as well. This trial is important since it will allow us to assess the usefulness of oral losartan. However, inhaled losartan is still a possibility if the human trial is negative and the sheep data are promising.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	There are ~600 patients in the Southeast FL CF Center Consortium. ~110 of them are on Orkambi and ~20 on Kalydeco.

Sites will be asked to limit the time from enrollment/randomization to ICD implantation to 1-2 weeks. After ICD implantation, there will be no scheduled face-to-face study visits. All study patients will be followed on a usual care basis. Sites will be asked to complete a brief electronic data collection form during the first post-ICD implantation visit (the timing of which will be per standard of care) that will be uploaded directly into the electronic data collection. The form will capture information on peri-procedure complications.  Every 6 months patients will be contacted by the DCRI Call Center to document vital status, medications, and hospitalizations. For a randomly selected subset of 400 patients, quality of life will be assessed by the DCRI Call Center at 12 and 24 months. Hospital records will be obtained to ascertain the accuracy of self-reported data. Data downloaded from ICDs will be saved and uploaded directly into the study database. The last patient enrolled will be followed for 30 months.	The study will enroll 1700 patients with a clinical indication for the placement of an ICD. We expect that the race and sex distributions of patients enrolled in the trial will be consistent with the overall population of patients entered in the NCDR ICD Registry (see Table 3 in the study synopsis). Entering data into this Registry is mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on all Medicare patients who receive a primary prevention ICD.	19	A total of 1700 patients will be enrolled in the DISCERN trial. These patients should meet the following enrollment criteria:     Inclusion Criteria:  1)\tPatients scheduled for an ICD for a CMS approved indication  2)\tBe at least 65 years of age  3)\tPatients with left ventricular dysfunction need to be on guideline-recommended medical therapy including ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and Beta-blockers.     Exclusion Criteria:  1)\tContraindication for ICD placement, for example those with  a.\tCardiac revascularization in the past 3 months in patients receiving a primary prevention ICD  b.\tA Class I indication for dual-chamber pacing like sick sinus syndrome, second or 3rd degree AV block  c.\tPermanent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (patients with persistent atrial fibrillation/flutter will be allowed)  2)\tEstimated life expectancy of <1 year from a non-cardiac cause  3)\tPregnant women or those with childbearing potential and not using a reliable method of contraception  4)\tInability to give a written informed consent	\N	The primary endpoint of the DISCERN trial is time to death or hospitalization for any of the following cardiovascular causes: heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, procedural complications, and device-related invasive interventions. Atrial fibrillation is defined as an irregular rhythm with no discernible p waves, has to be captured by an ECG or continuous telemetry recording, and has to be of 1 hour duration based on symptoms and/or length of recording (i.e. capturing atrial fibrillation on an ICD electrogram will not be enough). Stroke is defined as a neurologic deficit lasting for more than 24 hours with or without radiologic deficit. Procedural complications may include cardiac perforation with or without tamponade, pneumothorax, hemothorax, myocardial infarction/stroke (if defibrillation threshold testing is performed), lead dislodgement requiring revision or replacement, ICD pocket hematoma that requires an invasive intervention (like evacuation or blood transfusion), and infection). Device-related invasive interventions may include adding a new lead to an existing device, replacing a lead, repositioning an existing lead, adjusting a loose setscrew (where the lead inserts into the header of the device), and replacing the device.     Secondary endpoints include the components of the primary endpoint in addition to inappropriate ICD shocks, rate of right ventricular pacing, and quality of life.	We have engaged 35 geographically diverse sites to ensure good representation of different regions in the United States. To be selected for the DISCERN trial, a site has to be an active participant in the NCDR ICD Registry and has to have experience in randomized clinical trials with good performance in enrolling patients and collecting and submitting data to the DCRI in a timely fashion. Table 4 of the synopsis shows the sites that we have engaged with projected enrollment based on a survey of these sites. We will continue to work on identifying more sites that meet our selection criteria mentioned above to reach a goal of up to 50 sites.  We anticipate that up to 10 sites may be in Canada .	\N	\N	\N	\N	Enrollment will begin in the third quarter of the first year and is expected to take 430 months.

This pragmatic clinical trial will randomize 1700 patients in a 1:1 ratio to either 1) single-chamber ICD (n=850) and 2) dual-chamber ICD (n=850). Patients will be consented, enrolled, randomized and then followed every 6 months for endpoint assessment.	\N	\N	365	\N	\N	141	\N	\N	Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio within a site to either a dual-chamber or a single-chamber ICD.  Patients will be followed throughout the study period until a common study stop date. Data will be analyzed according to the Intention-to-treat principle.  This study is designed to test whether a dual-chamber ICD is superior to a single-chamber ICD in reducing the primary endpoint of time to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalizations. The following assumptions were used to obtain the total sample size of 1,700 patients:  1) The 3-year rate of the primary endpoint in the single-chamber ICD arm is 35%.  2) The primary endpoint will be reduced by 25% with a dual-chamber ICD (i.e. hazard ratio of 0.75).  3) 2-sided Type I error of 0.05  4) Loss to follow-up about 8% over 3 years or ~2.5% per year    Assuming enrollment over a 15 months will result in power of approximately 85%. Assuming enrollment over 30 months will result in approximately 80% power. The randomly selected cohort of 400 participants for the quality of life substudy will provide approximately 75%-90% power to detect clinically meaningful differences (i.e. 4 points) on the Duke Activity Status Index instrument.     Baseline demographic and clinical variables will be summarized for each arm of the study. Descriptive summaries of the distribution of continuous variables will be presented in terms of percentiles (e.g., median, 25th and 75th percentiles), while discrete variables will be summarized in terms of frequencies and percentages.     The comparison of the 2 randomized arms with respect to the primary endpoint will be a time-to-event analysis, and therefore will be based on the time from randomization to all-cause death. The Cox proportional hazards regression model will be the primary tool to assess outcome differences between the two treatment arms. The Cox model will include an indicator variable for treatment group, reason for ICD implantation, history of atrial fibrillation, age, and sex.    DISCERN is a large, multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate a therapy that may improve survival and major morbidity. Therefore, it fits the profile of a trial requiring an independent DSMB. An interim examination of key safety and effectiveness endpoint data will be performed at regular intervals during the course of the trial. The results of the interim analyses and status reports will be carefully and confidentially reviewed by an NHLBI-appointed DSMB. The DSMB will meet at 6-month intervals to review the accumulating data. We propose that the DSMB focuses on the endpoint of all-cause mortality. Given that both single- and dual-chamber ICDs are commonly used in clinical practice, we recommend that the DSMB applies the conservative Haybittle-Peto boundary for their review of the all-cause mortality endpoint. It is anticipated that the DSMB will review detailed safety data every 6 months once enrollment has commenced. A separate DSMB charter will outline the operating guidelines for the committee, and the protocol for evaluation of data.	\N	\N	\N	Canada	7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	31	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	We do not anticipate any challenges with recruitment and expect to have a full list of 50 sites who have indicated an interest in participating in the trial at time of application.	12-Mar-2018:  Submitting PI did not want a full Kick-off meeting.  An update to the PAT was completed.	\N	\N	\N	The DISCERN trial will compare single-chamber ICDs with dual-chamber ICDs. Because our RCT is focused on older patients who are more likely to require pacing that cannot be provided by subcutaneous ICDs, we do not include subcutaneous ICDs as a comparator in our trial. Clinical trials of subcutaneous ICDs enrolled relatively younger patients with a mean age of 54 years. Although leadless pacemakers can be added to subcutaneous ICDs, those do not offer atrial pacing and as such are far from ideal for patients with sick sinus syndrome who are not in permanent atrial fibrillation.    Single- and dual-chamber ICDs are the comparators in this trial as the controversy surrounding the best type of ICD addressed in this research only applies to single and dual-chamber ICDs. This controversy does not apply to ICDs with cardiac resynchronization therapy (devices with a right ventricular lead and a left ventricular lead), a therapy for heart failure, as there is consensus that inserting an atrial lead (in addition to the right and left ventricular leads) is the best approach in the vast majority of recipients of this type of device.   All ICDs on the market today are capable of bradycardia pacing and tachycardia detection and treatment. For bradycardia pacing, single-chamber ICDs will be programmed in VVI-40 (V=pacing in right ventricle, V=sensing in right ventricle, and I=inhibition of pacing by sensed native beats, 40 bpm pacing rate). Dual-chamber ICDs will be programmed in AAI-50 (A=pacing in right atrium, A=sensing in right atrium, and I=inhibition of pacing by sensed native beats, 50 bpm pacing rate). Because a high burden of right ventricular pacing could lead to cardiomyopathy in about 30% of patients, one of our main goals is to minimize right ventricular pacing in both arms of the study. Because some differences exist in programming features of ICDs manufactured by different vendors, we will mandate programming parameters that will make these devices as similar as possible. In devices that allow managed ventricular pacing (MVP) by pacing in AAI mode and switching to DDD (D=pacing in right atrium and right ventricle, D=sensing in right atrium and right ventricle, and D=dual response to sensing) pacing mode only if the patient has 2 consecutive non-conducted p waves, we will require this feature to be turned on. In devices that do not have the MVP feature, pacing mode will be AAI-50 and if type 2 second degree atrioventricular block (AVB) or third degree AVB is developed in follow-up, we will require that AAI be switched to DDD. In that circumstance, if a patient develops NYHA class I, II or III heart failure symptoms, pacing in the right ventricle >40-50% of the time and an LVEF <50%, physicians will be encouraged to change the patient's device to a biventricular device based on the results of the Biventricular versus Right Ventricular Pacing in Heart Failure Patients with Atrioventricular Block (BLOCK-HF) trial.67 Once this occurs, follow-up for that patient will be censored.

Sample size: Based on ongoing studies in our group, we estimate that with 250 subjects (125/group), we would have 90% power (alpha = 0.05) to document (on average) prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women. Factoring in a potential drop our rate over 2 years of 40%, we plan to recruit 354 women (118 at each of 3 sites).  Gender: Female only, as the study focuses on prevention of postmenopausal bone loss.  Age: Postmenoapusal women, aged 50-70 years.  General health status: Otherwise generally healthy (see inclusion/exclusion criteria).  Geographic locations: Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN), Columbia University Medical Center (New York, NY), Maine Medical Center (Portland, ME).	145	We will recruit normal postmenopausal women (FSH > 20 IU/L) aged 50-70 years. Exclusion criteria will be as follows: 1) clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or fasting plasma glucose > 126 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c > 6.5%; 2) abnormality in any of the additional screening laboratory studies (see below); 3) presence of significant liver or renal disease, malignancy, malabsorption, hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, hypopituitarism, pheochromocytoma, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 4) undergoing treatment with any medications that affect bone turnover, including the following: corticosteroids (> 3 months within the past year or sustained inhaled corticosteroid use, permitting occasional seasonal use), anticonvulsant therapy (phenytoin, carbamazepine within the past year), pharmacological doses of thyroid hormone (causing decline of thyroid stimulating hormone below normal), bisphosphonates (within the past 3 years), denosumab, estrogen therapy or treatment with a selective estrogen receptor modulator, or teriparatide (within the past year). Subjects with a clinical history of osteoporotic fracture (vertebral, hip, or distal forearm) will also be excluded, as will subjects with any recent (within the past 6 months) fracture. As subjects with a spine or femur neck T-score < -2.5 would be candidates for standard osteoporosis drugs, these subjects will also be excluded. If found to have low body stores of vitamin D (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of < 20 ng/ml), subjects will be treated with 1000 units/day of vitamin D for 8 weeks and then rechecked. If the level is still < 20 ng/ml, they will receive a second 8 week course of vitamin D; if, following that, the level is still < 20 ng/ml, they will not be enrolled in the study and will be referred to their primary physician for further evaluation. Additional exclusionary criteria will include any subject with a resting systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or heart rate < 60 bpm. We will also obtain a baseline ECG.	\N	Our primary endpoints will be changes in BMD by DXA at the lumbar spine and femur neck (Aim 1a) along with evaluating the tolerability and safety of atenolol when used for the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women (Aim 1b). Secondary endpoints will include radius, ultra-distal radius, and total hip BMD. Additional secondary endpoints will be changes in trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture at the distal radius and tibia using HR-pQCT (Aim 2a) and in bone turnover markers (CTx, TRAP5b, PINP, osteocalcin; Aim 2b). In exploratory analyses that may have clinical utility for selecting appropriate patients for using a β-blocker to prevent bone loss, we will test whether baseline measures of bone turnover or of sympathetic activity (resting heart rate, plasma catecholamine levels) are predictive of the BMD response to atenolol over 2 years (Aim 2c). Finally, Aim 3 will expand the scope of the clinical trial in a mechanistic direction and explore the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms for the effects of β1-selective blockade on bone in humans using analyses of osteoblast populations isolated from these biopsies (Aim 3a) as well as bone histomorphometry of quadruple-labelled bone biopsies to definitively evaluate the effects of β1-selective blockade on bone formation (Aim 3b).	The proposed study is a partnership of 4 CTSA sites: Mayo (Drs. Sundeep Khosla, Matthew Drake, and Ms. Elizabeth Atkinson), Columbia University Medical Center (Drs. Elizabeth Shane, Stavroula Kousteni, David Dempster, Adi Cohen, and Tom Nickolas), Maine Medical Center (Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network, Drs. Clifford Rosen Irwin Brodsky), and UCSF (Dr. Dennis Black). Mayo, Columbia, and Maine all have active clinical trials programs and DXA and will be recruiting sites for the primary study endpoints in Aim 1; Mayo and Columbia both have HR-pQCT devices and subjects from these sites will be studied in Aim 2; the bone biopsies for molecular and cellular analyses for Aim 3 will be done in a further subset of subjects at the Columbia site. Mayo will house the Data Coordinating Center and UCSF will oversee Data Monitoring and Safety activities as well as the DXA and HR-pQCT analyses. In addition, Dr. Robert Recker (Creighton University) will perform the bone histomorphometry analyses in collaboration with Dr. Dempster.	\N	\N	\N	\N	60 months.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	10	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	We propose a phase 3 study to repurpose an FDA-approved drug, atenolol, for the prevention of bone loss in post-menopausal women.

Recruitment will be at 3 sites (Mayo, Columbia, Maine). As Mayo and Maine have predominantly white subjects, Columbia will focus more on minority recruitment. Each site will enroll 118 subjects over the course of ~18 months. This estimate is base on extensive clinical trial/clinical study experience at each of the performance sites.	The study entitled "Beta1-selective blockade for prevention of postmenopausal bone loss: A randomized controlled trial"  is a Phase 3 study to repurpose an FDA-approved drug, atenolol, for the prevention of bone loss in post-menopausal women. It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-year clinical trial. His main aims are to test the hypothesis that treatment with a widely used, inexpensive, and relatively β1-selective blocker (atenolol) will prevent bone loss at the lumbar spine and femur neck in postmenopausal women as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and to evaluate the tolerability and safety of atenolol when used for the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women. Aim to enroll 250 women between the ages of 50-70 at three sites with participant duration being 24 months.  NIA grant submission in February 2019 with a proposed 1.5 million budget for a 5 year study duration.	\N	\N	\N	Following recruitment, the subjects will be randomly assigned to placebo or atenolol, 50 mg/day. Block randomization will be used so that equal numbers of subjects will be assigned to each treatment arm for each block of 15 subjects. In addition, we will stratify subjects based on duration of menopause (< 5 yrs versus ≥ 5 yrs) in order to ensure that the 2 groups were balanced for the number of women undergoing the more rapid early menopausal phase of bone loss. Study staff and participants will both be blinded with regards to group assignments. Throughout the study, all participants will take 800 IU of vitamin D that will be supplied to them, unless they are currently taking a multivitamin that contains ≥ 500 IU of Vitamin D. These subjects will be instructed to continue taking their multivitamin daily throughout the study. They will also be counseled on a total calcium intake of ~1000 mg/d. We will obtain resting heart-rate and blood pressure following 5 minutes of seated rest before the blood draws. Fasting blood will be drawn for baseline assessment of bone formation (serum PINP and OCN) and resorption markers (serum CTX and TRAP5b). At the baseline visit, we will also obtain a plasma sample for measurement of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) using a standardized protocol (patient resting in the supine position in a quiet room for 30 minutes and blood drawn through an indwelling catheter). All subjects will be given a blank notebook for recording adverse events. They will be instructed to bring this with them to each appointment for the study team to review and document. The study subjects will return as outpatients to the CRU for assessment of pill counts and fasting morning blood samples at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Height will be obtained with a customized height gauge and weight with an electronic scale. A subset of the subjects (n = 25/group) will also return at 3 months for the bone biopsies for cell analyses and bone histomorphometry (see below, Aim 3). Subjects will need to have nothing to eat or drink after midnight (except water) and no caffeinated beverages or tobacco use for at least 4 hours, as well as avoid strenuous exercise the day previously, prior to all blood samples other than the screen visit. All of the parameters measured at baseline will be measured at each of these time points, except for the plasma catecholamines, which will only be measured at baseline.  Spine, hip, total body and forearm BMD by DXA will be measured at each time point and bone microarchitectural parameters at the radius and tibia by HRpQCT will be measured at baseline, 12, and 24 months. Subjects will also have baseline and endpoint vertebral fracture assessment by DXA, and we will record all clinical fractures during the course of the study.	1	382	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	23	5	\N	\N	\N	We will perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-year clinical trial addressing the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1.  (Primary objective) Test the hypothesis that treatment with a widely used, inexpensive, and relatively β1-selective blocker (atenolol) will prevent bone loss at the lumbar spine and femur neck in 354 postmenopausal women as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Aim 1a); and evaluate the tolerability and safety of atenolol when used for the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women (Aim 1b).  Aim 2. (Secondary objective) Evaluate the effects of atenolol on trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture using high resolution-peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT; Aim 2a), on bone turnover markers (Aim 2b), and test whether baseline measures of bone turnover or of sympathetic activity (resting heart rate, plasma catecholamine levels) are predictive of the bone mineral density (BMD) response to atenolol over 2 years (Aim 2c).  Aim 3.  (Secondary objective) In a subset of patients, explore the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms for the effects of β1-selective blockade on bone in humans using analyses of osteoblast populations isolated from these biopsies (Aim 3a) as well as bone histomorphometry of quadruple-labelled bone biopsies (Aim 3b).  Thus, the proposed studies will rigorously test whether atenolol is efficacious and safe for the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women and also further define the mechanisms of sympathetic nervous system effects on bone in humans.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	4	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	354	\N	\N

Hence the calculated time of enrollment in the study will typically be <4 months total.	Sample size: 720 NICU infants, including those that drop-out or lost-to-follow-up, based on prior experience.  The power analysis demonstrated that data from 600 subjects will provide sufficient power to determine if the hypotheses described above are supported or rejected.  Gender: both/all  Age at enrollment >23 weeks and <35 weeks gestational age (GA) at birth.  All subjects will be prospectively enrolled.  Demographic groups: Enrolled subjects will be < 35 weeks of age at birth, and generally enrolled at <2 weeks post-natal age.  We will strive to match the ethnic/racial demographics of each study site/city (3 sites, see below) in which the study is proposed to be conducted at, and this will be dependent on admissions to the NICU at the time the study is conducted.  General health status: premature babies >23 weeks GA and < 35 weeks GA; many are at risk of sepsis and are treated with aminoglycosides and B-lactams, and a subset will be treated with antibiotics for >5 days.  Geographic locations:  All US cities, with diverse populations: (1) Portland, Oregon in the Pacific Northwest; (2) New York City, on the Atlantic seaboard; and (3) Nashville, Tennessee in the Southern region of the USA.	3	Inclusion criteria for eligible subjects include: >23 and <35 weeks GA at birth and enrolled within 7 days of admission to the NICU.\t  Exclusion criteria include: birth at <23 (or >35) weeks corrected GA; infants receiving palliative care ; a diagnosis of congenital hearing loss, or other known causes of hearing loss, including: hypoxia and infections such as congenital herpes simplex, rubella, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, or meningitis.  Patients with known craniofacial or otologic abnormalities such as midfacial hypoplasia, microtia or aural atresia, Down syndrome, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and exchange transfusions for hyperbilirubinemia will also be excluded due to potential association with hearing loss.	\N	Aim 1: Is the risk of hearing loss in NICU graduates greater with higher cumulative gentamicin dosing?  Unlike preclinical models, there is little data in humans showing the dose-dependency and frequency-selectivity of gentamicin-induced hearing loss in humans.    Expected Results:  As in pilot data (Cross et al., 20151), we predict: (i) an increased occurrence of in-hospital DPOAE referrals will dose-dependently correlate with increasing cumulative gentamicin dosing; (ii) the occurrence of in-hospital referrals will be significantly greater at higher frequencies (≥4 kHz) than at lower frequencies (<4 kHz), characteristic of ototoxicity, (iii) in-hospital DPOAE referrals will be greater than those from in-hospital automated ABR screens.  These predicted outcomes will demonstrate that: (a) greater gentamicin dosing induces significantly greater degrees of hearing loss, from higher to lower frequencies, demonstrating both the dose-dependency and frequency-selectivity of gentamicin-induced hearing loss in NICU infants for the first time; and (b) at pre- and post-discharge time points, higher frequency DPOAE assessments and tone-specific ABRs will capture more NICU infants with hearing loss, yet had passed both the click ABR, and lower frequency DPOAE assessments.    Aim 2: Does (suspected) sepsis increase the risk of gentamicin-induced ototoxicity in NICU infants?  Systemic (non-otologic) inflammation is not associated with hearing loss.  However, pilot data show that NICU subjects with objective signs of (suspected) sepsis and ≥5 days of gentamicin therapy have a 2-fold greater risk of being referred on a frequency-specific DPOAE assessment in-hospital compared to their peers without sepsis (Cross et al., 2015).  Expected Results:  We predict that:  (i) NICU graduates with (suspected) sepsis or clinical signs of inflammation plus concurrent gentamicin exposure for >4 days will have significantly greater odds of in-hospital, and follow-up, DPOAE referrals, and increased higher frequency hearing loss by diagnostic audiometry compared to all other subjects; (ii) NICU graduates with longer NICU stays (hence likely greater cumulative gentamicin dosing) and (suspected) sepsis/inflammation will have greater degrees of hearing loss (from higher to lower frequencies) than NICU graduates with equivalent gentamicin dosing without indications of (suspected) sepsis/inflammation.  These predicted outcomes will provide evidence-based data to identify alternate (non-aminoglycoside) antimicrobial treatments (where possible) when in the setting of inflammation/sepsis in NICUs and other settings with intravenous aminoglycoside dosing, e.g., cystic fibrosis clinics.      These outcomes from both Aims will also show that ototoxic monitoring protocols using higher frequency bandwidths will identify more NICU infants with drug-induced hearing loss, compared to traditional newborn hearing screening assessments.  Findings will also establish whether auditory performance changes following discharge, to reveal stabilized levels, or continuing progression, of hearing loss clinically.  If these anticipated outcomes result in enhanced standard of clinical audiometry in NICUs (i.e., ototoxicity monitoring), this will enable clinicians to identify earlier which at-risk NICU infants have acquired hearing loss (ototoxicity).  Earlier identification of hearing loss in at-risk infants will allow earlier implementation of auditory rehabilitation strategies that are more effective, with better long-term outcomes, when implemented as soon as possible after onset (or identification) of hearing loss.	This planned project will take place at 3 US sites: Oregon Health & Science University (Portland Oregon), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee), and Columbia University Medical Center (New York City, New York State).  Each site has a research-oriented NICU that allows us up to recruit 720 subjects (including drop-outs and loss-to-follow-up) to test the above mentioned hypotheses.    This study is not intended to enroll subjects outside of the USA.	\N	\N	\N	\N	4.5 years      -  6 months preparation time (4/2019-9/2019)      -  48 months for enrollment (10/2019-9/2023)      -  6 months to complete data analyses (10/2023-3/2024)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	8	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	NICU infants receiving intravenous gentamicin will be screened for eligibility by the research nurse and enrolled into the study with parental written consent. Participants will have their hearing screened by a research audiologist prior to discharge from the NICU, then return for a follow-up diagnostic hearing evaluation within three months of hospital discharge. For the in-hospital hearing screen, we will measure auditory performance using bedside click-evoked auditory brainstem response (cABR) test and a high frequency distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) assessment (to 10 kHz) prior to discharge.  These tests will be repeated at the follow-up appointment, in addition to other clinical tests of hearing function, i.e., diagnostic auditory brainstem response (ABR) measures to 8 kHz.	\N	\N	197	\N	\N	59	\N	\N	For Aim 1: Is the risk of hearing loss in NICU graduates greater with higher cumulative gentamicin dosing?  We will examine demographic and maternal health status variables for all subjects and by each site to examine differences between sites.  We will conduct group analyses for screening ABRs and DPOAE assessments, separately, using 2-factor repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA; group X frequency) to examine changes in DPOAE assessments in-hospital versus follow-up; and also for correlation between DPOAE assessments and diagnostic ABR measures.    We will use a mixed-effects logistic regression model to estimate odds of hearing loss among those who received ≥4 days of gentamicin dosing compared to those who received <4 days of gentamicin dosing.  This type of modeling allows us to study the effects of dosing on hearing loss after adjusting for co-morbidities (e.g., illness severity through SNAPPE and APGAR scores, gestational age at birth), co-variates such as overall ambient sound levels in the NICU, co-therapeutics (vancomycin or loop diuretics), and subject demographics, in terms of Odds ratios (OR).  The use of a mixed-effects model will allow the flexibility to account for any between-site variability.  The mixed model is also useful to make inferences about individuals in addition to population averages, and the influence of covariates on a specific subject's response.  We will also examine if there is a significant trend of increasing odds of hearing loss with increasing gentamicin dosing by stratifying cumulative dosing into tertiles or quartiles as the data allows, as described previously (Garinis et al., 2017).  Finally, we will perform model diagnostics and examine model fit statistics such as a C-statistic and/or Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and/or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) in order to examine how well the model fits the data.    For Aim 2: Does (suspected) inflammation increase the risk of ototoxicity in NICU infants?  We will examine patient demographics and maternal health status variables, overall and by site in an effort to examine differences between sites.  We will use a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a random intercept for each site to account for site variability, to estimate individual main effects of gentamicin dosing and (suspected) sepsis or inflammation, the synergistic effect of both factors on hearing loss, and adjust for potential confounders such as ambient noise and other co-morbidities, covariates of interest (e.g., vancomycin or loop diuretics), and demographics among NICU infants.  We will also examine the synergistic effect under different dose cut-points (e.g. ≥4 days of gentamicin dosing, ≥5 days of gentamicin dosing) in an attempt to quantify the dose with the highest risk of hearing loss.  Finally, we will perform model diagnostics and examine model fit statistics such as a C-statistic and/or AIC and/or BIC (as in Aim 1) in order to examine how well the model fits the data.\t  To examine the effects of potential misclassification, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis among those infants that do not meet the clinical criteria for sepsis, suspected sepsis or sepsis syndrome to better estimate the amount of potential attenuation of the association.	\N	\N	\N	\N	5	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	8	For Key personnel:  Steyger (OHSU, PI):  none  Garinis (OHSU, co-PI):  none  Douglas (OHSU, co-I):  none  Tharpe (VUMC, site PI):  none reported  Weitkamp (VUMC, co-I):  none reported   Kuhlmey (CUMC, site PI): none reported  Garey (CUMC, co-I):  none	\N	\N	\N	\N	The power analyses revealed that ~720 subjects are needed to test the hypothesis in Aim 2, and this provides more than sufficient statistical power (>80%) to test the hypothesis in Aim 1.

Based on our pilot study1, we need to screen and approach 2.5x as many eligible admissions to meet the enrollment goal, ~720 subjects, which includes those lost to follow up.  We have sufficient eligible patients at each site to meet this eligible/consented ratio and achieve our recruitment goals over 4 years.  All sites will begin enrolling by 10/2019, 6 months following the anticipated start of the funding period, 4/2019.      At OHSU, the number of live births was 2474 in 2016.  The number of preterm births with a gestational age (GA) >23 and <35 weeks admitted to OHSU's NICU was 234 in 2016, and 187 in 2017.  Of these, 226 (in 2016) and 180 (in 2017) would have been eligible for this study (after exclusion criteria applied).  Thus, OHSU has sufficient admissions (203) to meet OHSU's eligibility screening goal of 125 (= 2.5 x peak annual enrollment goal [50]).  OHSU will enroll 4-5 subjects/month, a total of 210 subjects over 48 months (4.3 subjects/month).    The NICU population at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) has ~900 NICU admissions/year with ~380 preterm admissions <35 weeks GA/year.  Of these, 330 (in 2016) and 405 (in 2017) would have been eligible for this study (after exclusion criteria applied).  Thus, CUMC has sufficient admissions to meet the eligibility screening goal of 125 (= 2.5 x peak annual enrollment goal [50]) to meet CUMC enrollment goals.  CUMC will enroll 4-5 subjects/month, a total of 210 subjects over 48 months (4.3 subjects/month).    The number of NICU admissions at Vanderbilt (VUMC) in 2016 was 1486, and 1641 in 2017.  The number of those between >23 and <35 weeks GA was 598 in 2016, and 596 in 2017 (after exclusion criteria applied).  Thus, VUMC has sufficient eligible admissions (~346) to meet VUMC screening goals (188 = 2.5 x maximum annual enrollment goal [75]) to meet the peak annual enrollment goal for VUMC (75).  VUMC to enroll 6-7 subjects/month, a total of 300 subjects over 48 months (6.25 subjects/month)  These data are based on census size for each site, and experience from the pilot study at OHSU, where 93 subjects were enrolled over 18 months (5.1 subjects/month).        Recruitment efforts to meet our enrollment goal will be based on consenting parents/guardians of infants admitted to the NICU who meet eligibility criteria during initial screening by research nurses shortly after admission.  We recognize that not all potential enrollees will be successfully consented, and therefore we have determined, from our pilot study, that 2.5x as many families must be approached to reach enrollment goals for each site.  Our cohort analyses have determined that this is feasible for each site.  1.\tCross et al., Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol 79, 1915-1919 (2015).	This is an observational study to determine (1) the risk of hearing loss in infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to cumulative intravenous aminoglycoside dosing, and (2) if (suspected) sepsis potentiates the risk of hearing loss in NICU graduates dosed with aminoglycosides.	\N	\N	\N	Not an interventional trial	2	299	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	13	3	\N	2	\N	In the United States, 12% (~480,000) of ~4 million live births are admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) each year.  As many as 4% of infants (~19,200) discharged from the NICU have severe hearing loss, compared to 0.3% (~10,500) of full-term births, and the etiology of this large difference remains poorly understood.  Congenital and acquired hearing loss during infancy has life-long consequences, with a socioeconomic lifetime burden of >$1 million per individual.  Earlier identification of hearing loss improves the efficacy of rehabilitative strategies and overall quality of life.  Systemic infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates admitted to the NICU.  Many NICU admissions exhibit risk factors for sepsis and are treated empirically, typically with ampicillin (a β-lactam) and gentamicin (an ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotic), until sepsis is ruled out over the next 48-72 hours.  Patients with confirmed sepsis (or suspected sepsis) remain on antibiotics for 7-10 days or more.  Yet, it remains unclear to what degree the hearing of NICU infants is affected by gentamicin dosing, especially with sepsis.     Our previous work suggests that aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss is potentiated by the inflammatory host response to sepsis or other diseases with long-term antimicrobial treatment, such as necrotizing enterocolitis.  Our long-term goal is to reduce the prevalence and degree of drug-induced hearing loss in infants discharged from the NICU (graduates).  We propose to determine whether the clinical effect of 2 parameters - cumulative gentamicin dosing, and confirmed or suspected sepsis -are associated with increased hearing loss, as in preclinical models.    Aim 1: Is the risk of hearing loss in NICU graduates greater with higher cumulative gentamicin dosing?  Unlike preclinical models, little data exists in humans showing the dose-dependency or frequency-selectivity of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss.  Our pilot data suggest that greater aminoglycoside dosing increases the risk of hearing loss in humans.  In a larger cohort, we propose to test the hypothesis that: Diagnostic hearing loss is associated with greater cumulative aminoglycoside dosing in NICU graduates.  Aim 2: Does (suspected) sepsis increase the risk of gentamicin-induced ototoxicity in NICU infants?   Aminoglycosides are essential to treat neonatal sepsis, yet sepsis can induce severe systemic inflammatory responses.  Systemic inflammation potentiates aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in preclinical models, and this ototoxic synergy needs to be verified in humans.  Pilot data show that NICU subjects with clinical signs of inflammation and ≥5 days of gentamicin dosing have a >2-fold greater risk of not passing a frequency-specific hearing assessment.  To validate pilot data in a larger cohort, we will test the hypothesis that: Confirmed or suspected sepsis increases the risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in NICU graduates.  If the anticipated data support these 2 hypotheses, these outcomes will predicate refining clinical protocols to reduce aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in vulnerable preterm infants:  If warranted, refined clinical protocols will improve the efficacy of auditory rehabilitation, and/or better preserve life-long auditory function, for NICU graduates to attain optimal listening and spoken language skills to fulfill their educational potential and make lifelong contributions to society.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	\N	720	\N	\N

Aim 3 : 12 months	Specific Aim 1: Patients will be recruited from primary care clinics.  A Barrett's Esophagus prevalence of 8% in the population and a test sensitivity and specificity of 95% are assumed. Using an estimated PPV of 0.3, a sample size of 89 test positives produces a two-sided 95% confidence interval with a width equal to 0.199. Assuming the NPV will be high (0.9), a sample size of 158 test positives produces a two-sided 95% confidence interval with a width equal to 0.1. Hence the SOS will be performed in approximately 1100 patients to obtain these test positive numbers. We estimate 100 test positives will undergo confirmatory testing with endoscopy and 200 test negative patients will undergo confirmatory endoscopy.    Specific Aim 2: Patients will be recruited from Endoscopy units in medical centers. Patients will be undergoing clinically indicated endoscopy.  A sample size of 400 True negatives and 200 True positives will be needed to make precise estimates of specificity and sensitivity as well as their respective determinants.

We would appreciate guidance on enrollment strategies.  Patient 2 : Patients will be recruited from centers where clinical endoscopy is performed. We would appreciate guidance on enrollment strategies.  Current experience : We have recruited over 300 patients as part of our initial pilot study (Prasad Iyer et al, Highly Discriminant Methylated DNA Markers for Non-endoscopic Detection of Barrett's Esophagus, Am J Gastroenterology 2018, in press) which included 40 patients and then over 260 patients in our current SOS 2 Trial (which is ongoing). SOS	Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a metaplastic change in the esophageal epithelium which increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma by 20-50 fold. BE progresses via  the development of histological dysplasia to adenocarcinoma. Sedated endoscopy is currently used to screen for BE.  This approach is invasive and expensive and not suitable for widespread application.  Endoscopic surveillance is  currently recommended for the detection of dysplasia but is limited by poor compliance and sampling error. We have developed and validated a minimally invasive tool ( a capsule sponge, which consists of a polyurethane foam sponge enclosed in a gelatin shell, attached to a string, [sponge on string : SOS] which is swallowed by the patient, followed by dissolution of the gelatin shell releasing a 25 mm compressible sponge.  The sponge is then pulled out with the attached string, providing esophageal cytology samples ) and novel molecular markers (methylated DNA markers [MDMs]) for the non-endoscopic detection of Barrett's esophagus and related dysplasia. Hence our central hypothesis is that novel discriminant MDMs assayed on esophageal cytology specimens obtained via the SOS device will enable accurate BE and prevalent dysplasia/EAC detection, in patients with and without chronic GERD.	\N	\N	\N	All participants recruited for this study will swallow the Sponge on a String (SOS) device. Participants will swallow the capsule sponge ((EsophaCap, Capnostics, Doylestown PA) with a few sips of water and will be given the option of pharyngeal anesthesia with lidocaine spray before or after swallowing the capsule. The sponge will then be pulled with the attached cord 8 minutes after swallowing the capsule (to allow sufficient time for the shell to dissolve completely and release the 25 mm compressible sponge). Endoscopy will be performed using standard technique and sedation. Surveillance biopsies will be obtained using standard biopsy forceps.	1	339	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	22	6	\N	\N	\N	To assess the positive and negative predictive value of a SOS test in a community screening cohort with and without chronic gastroesophageal reflux.

For headache and stiff neck, the NeuroQoL Pediatric Pain Instrument will be administered to the child. This instrument has been validated to measure pain in children, is designed to be completed in approximately one minute, and is available in Spanish. The NeuroQoL Pediatric Pain Instrument uses a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. For children that are unable to provide a self-report, we will use a parent proxy-report. Resolution of headache / stiff neck will be defined as a Neuro-QOL Scale score < 55 (which is 0.5 SDs above population mean).  For children with cranial neuritis, parents will be asked whether the child still has a facial droop (yes/no) response.    Secondary (quality of life) outcome data will be quality of life as measured using the PedsQL instrument administered 6 months after enrollment. Data will be collected by telephone, which is reliable for children in our proposed age range [36]. The PedsQL instrument has been validated and used for a variety of illnesses with neurologic manifestations [37]-[40]. The 23 item PedsQL includes measures of physical, emotional, social, and school function and takes less than 4 minutes to complete. A Spanish language version is available. The child self-report is recommended for children 8 -17 years old. For children who are unable to provide a self-report, we will obtain a parent proxy-report.

Objective 2: To collect longitudinal data on children with Lyme meningitis and facial palsy at 25 hospitals in endemic areas of the U.S. This data will be used to answer comparative effectiveness questions including our hypotheses that oral doxycycline is more cost effective than IV ceftriaxone for the treatment of Lyme meningitis in children and that glucocorticoids worsen outcomes in children with Lyme disease-related facial palsy.    Objective 3: To establish a biobank of CSF samples from children with Lyme disease and Lyme disease mimics.

Data from Rowe et al were used for estimated group sample sizes of 18. This sample size achieves 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal means when the DNPD mean difference is -5.0 with a standard deviation for both groups of 5.2 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample equal-variance t-test. Even with 20% attrition, the power remains acceptable using most-polarized nostril at each visit.	48	Inclusion criteria: CFTR/BK activity recovery with losartan on Orkambi�     �       CF patients homozygous for F508del and on current treatment with Orkambi� for at least 3 months       �       Age >12 years       �       FEV1 between 40 - 100% of predicted       Exclusion criteria     �       When enrolling female patients       �       Not willing to adhere to strict birth control (combination of two methods)       �       Pregnancy       �       Intolerance to ARBs       �       Treatment with ACE inhibitor       �       NPD response to 0Cl/isoproterenol of > - 6.6 mV at screening (evidence of detectable CFTR activity at baseline)       �       Regular use of NSAIDs or potassium supplementation, treatment with aliskiren, on anticoagulation       �       Oral corticosteroid use within 6 weeks       �       Exacerbation requiring treatment within 6 weeks       �       Treatment of mycobacterial infections       �       Significant hypoxemia (oxygen saturation <90% on room air and rest or use of continuous oxygen treatment), chronic respiratory failure by history (pCO2 > 45 mmHg), clinical evidence of cor pulmonale       �       Untreated arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg)       �       Blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg systolic while standing       �       Cardiac, renal (creatinine 1.5 times normal limit), hepatic (LFTs > 3x normal upper limit), neurological, psychiatric, endocrine or neoplastic diseases that are judged to interfere with participation in study       �       Known renal artery stenosis       �       Concomitant airway disorders other than CF, such as ABPA or asthma       �       Subjects with prior thoracic surgery	\N	Endpoints         �       Primary endpoint         �       DNPD with 0 Cl-/isoproterenol as a measure of CFTR activity in losartan treatment compared to placebo (58), done according to standard procedures (59), for power calculation, see below.

The additional benefit for BK channels could be important, but is harder to measure their function in vivo as an endpoint in patients. Towards this end, however, we will assess CaCC/BK activity together as the response to ATP during NPD measurements, even though this is not an accurate reflection of either channel on its own. Notions that CaCC currents in NPD measurements in CF patients are higher than in normal subjects stem from the lack of a negative deflection of PD in CF patients in response to 0 Cl / isoproterenol addition: the total deflection in normal subjects is usually still higher than the total deflection in CF patients. Primary hypothesis: Losartan at 1.4 mg/kg (pediatric) or 100 mg (adult) for 12 weeks will improve CFTR conductance as measured with NPD. We expect that compared to placebo, DNPD in response to 0 Cl-/isoproterenol will change by -4 mV using the most polarized nostril each time. Secondary hypotheses: Losartan 1.4 mg/kg (pediatric) or 100 mg (adult) for 12 weeks will improve BK and CaCC activity as assessed with ATP using NPD and will also reduce nasal cytokine levels and systemic inflammatory markers.       Study plan: 36 patients with CF, > 12 years of age, who are homozygous for F508del and have been on treatment with Orkambi� for at least 3 months will be recruited for this trial. This trial will be randomized 1:1 with placebo (n=18 for each group). After signing informed consent at the screening visit, we will perform spirometry, determine sweat chloride, take blood (see below), and test for pregnancy where applicable. Since losartan has teratogenic effects, we will enforce strict birth control in female participants. Eligible patients will complete visits as outlined below. Quality of life will be assessed by CFQ-R. NPD will use standard protocols and so will nasal cell harvest (see below for assessments). Cytokines will be measured from nasal fluid recovered by Leukosorb filter paper. There will be two visits for these different nasal assessments to assure that nasal cell fluid and cell collection will not influence NPD and vice versa. After assessing baselines, a daily dose of 0.7 mg/kg (pediatric) or 50 mg (adult) losartan or placebo will be started. A safety visit will occur after 7 days of treatment (� 2 days) and the losartan dose (or placebo) increased to 1.4 mg/kg (pediatric) or 100 mg (adult) daily (higher dose is likely needed to get anti-inflammatory effect in airways if present). Since this trial assesses anti-inflammatory effects of losartan (and lack of placebo), the total duration will be 14 weeks to achieve 12 weeks of treatment with losartan (or placebo). If exacerbations occur, the patient will report and come for a sick visit.	\N	\N	582	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Analysis: Primary endpoint: A t-test will be used as preliminary data analysis. For the formal analysis, mixed effects models model will be used for analysis to accommodate the paired measures nature of the design, as well as missing values under the MAR assumption. We will determine the final analytic approach based on the final available data. Examination of baseline differences on key variables between subjects remaining and those lost-to-follow-up will also be conducted. The first set of analyses will not adjust for dropouts. Only cases with complete data will be included.        Secondary endpoints: Prior to analysis, we will investigate the distributional properties of the defined outcome measures - such as CaCC/BK activity, change in sweat chloride concentration, FEV1, changes in serum inflammatory markers, etc. Necessary transformations such as logarithmic or square root will be applied to satisfy normality assumptions if necessary. Baseline values of all variables will be examined, and estimates of baseline means and changes over time will be provided. The statistical analysis will consist of descriptive statistics associated with outcome measure (mean change or mean difference pre and post treatment) for two treatments. Means at baseline, 7 and 13/14 weeks, for each outcome, as well as the change over time will be provided, as well as the corresponding estimates of variability, and 95% confidence intervals will be constructed. t-tests for comparisons of the changes over the period between treatments will be conducted. However, the primary focus for this analysis is to obtain reliable estimates of the mean changes and variability, which will be useful for designing further investigation focused and specifically powered for comparing these outcomes. P-value will be significant if < 0.05. All tests will be two-tailed. The SAS statistical software package version 9.3 (Cary, NC) will be used for all statistical analyses.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	There are currently 51 patients (53% male) in the Southeast Florida CF Center consortium that fulfill the inclusion criteria of being treated with Orkambi for >3 months, being >12 years of age and having an FEV1 of >40% predicted. In addition, the centers in Orlando and at the University of FL have pledged help for enrollment if needed; they have a combined additional 34 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria (see letters). In Cincinnati, there are currently 45 eligible patients. In Birmingham, there are additional patients.

A safety visit will be done 1 week after each new dosing. Trial is randomized 1:1 to active drug and placebo (pharmacy will provide drug and placebo; randomization occurs through the biostatistics core).               Measurements       �       Visits will occur for screening, baseline and then treatment according to schedule attached.       �       Sample collection will include NPD, sweat chloride, nasal cell and fluid collection, spirometry, CFQ-R, serum C-reactive protein (hsCRP), WBC (including absolute neutrophil count, % PMNs), serum alpha-SAA, calprotectin, and GM-CSF. In addition, losartan and EXP3179/3174 levels will be assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (40,41). Exacerbation assessment, defined according to the TRAFFIC/TRANSPORT studies (34) will occur during sick visits. Nasal airway epithelial cells will be taken by brush for mRNA expression levels of TGF-b and LRRC26. Details are listed below and most methods were described above in preliminary data.       Pharmacy   Losartan and matching placebo (both in pill and suspension form for children) will be prepared at the Research Pharmacy of the University of Miami. Our research pharmacy head Dr. Jiale Dai will supervise drug preparation and ship/deliver study drug to sites. The Research Pharmacy at the University of Miami will be informed about randomization by the biostatistics core and will ship the randomized drug blinded to the investigators at the two sites once participants become eligible for randomization. Costs for drug and placebo are accounted for as are the pharmacy fees (see budget).	\N	87	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	3	\N	1	\N	The life span of patients with CF continues to be shortened by progressive lung disease. CF can be caused by ~2000 mutations in the CFTR gene. These mutations can be, even though imperfectly, classified into 5 groups, permitting the development of small molecules that rescue group-specific CFTR mutants. These small molecules made remarkable impacts on patients. The CFTR potentiator ivacaftor (Kalydeco�), approved by the FDA mainly for class III mutations, has shown improvements in ion transport (large decrease in sweat chloride), clinical outcome (increase in FEV1 and weight, decrease in exacerbation rates), and quality of life. However, ivacaftor did not immediately eliminate airway inflammation, despite improvement in CFTR conductance, at least not within 12 month. However, airway inflammation is associated with morbidity in CF and additional anti-inflammatory treatment options are needed. F508del, a class II mutation, is the most common mutation in the US CF population. The FDA recently approved Orkambi�, a corrector and potentiator (lumacaftor and ivacaftor), to reduce exacerbations in F508del homozygous patients, even though the effect of Orkambi� on lung function and sweat chloride was modest at best. One explanation for this suboptimal efficacy in vivo could be the ongoing airway inflammation as outlined above. In this context, increased production of TGF-beta1 is common in CF airways and has been associated with worse pulmonary outcome. In particular, TGF-beta1 has been shown to decrease the ability of lumacaftor to rescue CFTR function and airway surface liquid (ASL) volume in vitro. TGF-beta1-associated inflammation also decreases the function of other ion channels important for ASL volume regulation: Calcium activated chloride channels (CaCC) and the apical potassium channel BK. We therefore propose that airway inflammation, especially via TGF-beta1, leads to a lower CaCC and BK activity, worsening mucociliary dysfunction in CF. Previous publications and our own preliminary data, show that clinically used Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) inhibit TGF-beta signaling, independent of their angiotensin receptor blocking ability. Thus, ARBs could present a 'fast track approach' for treating airway inflammation in CF, thereby enhancing the efficacy of lumacaftor for homozygous F508del patients. In fact, our preliminary data show that ARBs re-establish the ability of lumacaftor to correct CFTR function in vitro in CF cells treated with TGF-beta1. We therefore propose to conduct a proof of concept clinical trial to test if administration of losartan augments CFTR function in vivo in patients who are on Orkambi�. While we will concentrate on CFTR function as a primary endpoint, namely that losartan's ability to inhibit TGF-beta signaling will not only augment CFTR conductance rescued by Orkambi� (primary hypothesis), we will also test our secondary hypothesis that losartan rescues other channel functions such as those of CaCC and BK.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	36	\N	\N

Participants would come from EMS settings, as in the original IMMEDIATE Trial, in addition to those getting very early treatment for suspected ACS in the emergency department (ED), to address the fact that half of all emergency patients with ACS do not come via EMS.  Besides providing more widely-applicable results, this should substantially expedite accrual compared to EMS-based enrollment alone.    Screening and Consent Procedures  EMS staff and/or ED physician will assess the patient using the ACI-TIPI predictive instruments to assist in the rapid and accurate identification of potential candidates for GIK and complete a screening form to determine a patient's eligibility if the 12-lead ECG shows at least one of the following:     A.    ACI-TIPI score of 75% or more    B.     TPI activated    C.     ECG shows a definitive acute MI with ST segment elevation based on local criteria    As per the initial IMMEDIATE trial, the IMMEDIATE -2 trial uses the 'exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research per 21CFR 50.24.      Statistical Analysis  The primary analytic group will be all those randomized to receive study drug as intent to treat (ITT), with a major secondary analytic group being a modified ITT (MITT) group, which includes all those who were randomized and were also continued on study drug for presumed ACS following ED evaluation.  Additionally, an analysis will be done on all those participants who presented with STEMI.    The primary endpoint for the Accelerated Approval cohort is a three step composite of 1) all-cause mortality, 2) cardiac arrest, and 3) infarct size, using a Finkelstein-Schoenfeld sequence, on which we have worked with FDA.  Of note, whereas to detect a 25% reduction in an endpoint of only all-cause mortality, 15,450 participants would be needed, and for a composite endpoint of mortality or cardiac arrest, for which 6,600 would be needed, when using a Finkelstein-Schoenfeld sequence of mortality, cardiac arrest, and infarct size, only 900 participants would be needed.  This should result in a faster and far less expensive trial, and is planned for the Accelerated Approval cohort. Specifically, the sample size estimation for the Accelerated Approval cohort is based on a simulation for the sequential composite endpoint, looking for statistical power to detect a 25% reduction, using the following rates based on the placebo events in the original IMMEDIATE Trial:  mortality, 6% vs. 4.5%; cardiac arrest 3% vs. 1.5%; and infarct size means of 8% vs. 4% of left ventricular mass.     For the Long-term Clinical Outcomes cohort, the calculation of sample size needed to detect a difference in HF hospitalization or death over two years is based on an event rate at one-year of 16% (control) vs. 12% (GIK), an event ratio of 0.75.  This results in a need for a total of 1,485 participants (743 per group) to have 90% power to compare Kaplan-Meier curves using a log-rank test.  Based on these projections, we envision a two-year enrollment period with two years of follow-up at approximately 25 ED/EMS sites.	\N	\N	678	\N	\N	99	\N	\N	Not provided	\N	\N	\N	\N	94	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	8	None to disclose at this point.	\N	\N	\N	f	Sites which performed well in the initial IMMEDIATE trial will be invited to participate in the IMMEDIATE-2 trial.

The SIREN network with its focus on emergency medicine may be another potential source of highly relevant sites, however as this network is currently at the pre-award stage this may not be feasible if we wish to have sites confirmed by Q4 2017.	Dr. Selker's proposed study, IMMEDIATE-2, is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical effectiveness trial. The purpose of this study is to test the impact of pharmacological myocardial metabolic support by intravenous (IV) glucose, insulin and potassium (GIK) for the treatment of participants early in the course of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and unstable angina pectoris (UAP).    Primary Hypothesis for Accelerated Approval Cohort    H1: Immediate GIK will have a beneficial effect on the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld composite endpoint of 1) all-cause mortality from the time of presentation through 30 days, 2) in-hospital cardiac arrest, and/or 3) infarct size measured up to 30 days.     Short-Term Secondary Hypotheses   H2: Immediate GIK will reduce the composite endpoint of all cause-mortality from the time of presentation    through 30 days or in-hospital cardiac arrest  H3: Immediate GIK treatment will lead to improved survival at 30 days  H4: Immediate GIK will reduce the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest  H5: Immediate GIK will reduce infarct size (Accelerated Approval Cohort only)    Primary Hypothesis for Long-Term Clinical Follow-Up   H6: Immediate GIK will reduce the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure over a two-year follow-up period or in-hospital cardiac arrest    Secondary Hypotheses for Long-Term Clinical Follow-Up   H7: Immediate GIK will lead to a reduction in all-cause mortality over a two-year follow-up period  H8: Immediate GIK will lead to a reduction in the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure over a two-year follow-up period  A total of 1,600 participants with symptoms consistent with ACS will be identified by emergency medical system (EMS) paramedics in the field prior to transport to the receiving hospital or by emergency department (ED) staff upon direct presentation to the hospital. All 1,600 participants will be randomized to receive a 12-hour IV infusion of either GIK or placebo. Data on this cohort will be collected for two years following treatment. The first 900 consenting participants also will be enrolled in an FDA Accelerated Approval Path Cohort.  Participants 30 years old and older with symptoms suggestive of ACS will be screened for eligibility by EMS or ED personnel. These participants must be seen by EMS or seen in ED's within 2.5 hours of symptom onset and will have had a 12-lead ECG performed. Participants who have end stage renal failure requiring dialysis and those presenting with Killip Class 3 or 4 AMIs will not be eligible for enrollment (Killip Class 3: heart failure with rales at least half-way up the lung fields; Killip Class 4: heart failure with cardiogenic shock and a systolic BP less than 90 mm Hg).     The primary endpoint for the Accelerated Approval Cohort will be the combination of the incidence of all-cause mortality from the time of presentation through 30 days, in-hospital cardiac arrest, 1 and infarct size up to 30 days. Two treatments will be compared on this composite end point using the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld approach. The primary endpoint for the Long-Term Clinical Follow-Up Cohort is the combination of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure over a two-year follow up period, or in-hospital cardiac arrest. The secondary endpoints include: composite of all cause-mortality at 30 days or in-hospital cardiac arrest; all-cause mortality at 30 days; incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest; infarct size up to 30 days; all-cause mortality at two years; hospitalization for heart failure at two years.	\N	\N	\N	Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to either placebo or Glucose-Insulin-Potassium IV infusion in the EMS setting or upon patient presenting to the ED. Study drug infusion will continue for 12 hours post initiation.    The intervention GIK solution will consist of 1 liter of 30% dextrose mixed with 80mEq of potassium chloride and 50 units of regular insulin. The placebo IV contains 5% dextrose.    During this 12 hour period laboratory tests for serum glucose and potassium will be drawn on all patients.    The initial 12 lead ECG will be retained as the baseline study ECG. Subsequent ECGs are typically performed as standard of care. Infarct size will be measured using sestamibi SPECT scan.    30 day, 6 month, 1 year and 2 year follow up is performed for all patients to determine rates of mortality, cardiac arrest or hospitalization for heart failure. Participants will be contacted by telephone and if not reachable, national death indexes and other sources will be used to obtain this information.	1	15	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	109	15	\N	1	\N	The objective of this study is to test the impact of pharmacological myocardial metabolic support, in the form of intravenous (IV) glucose, insulin and potassium (GIK), for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and unstable angina pectoris (UAP).

Eligible study participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to long-term suppressive treatment with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily or placebo for one year, and followed every 3 months for a total of 18 months, to determine outcomes of new or worsening anterior segment ocular disease (e.g. dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis, and/or iritis) and/or severity and duration of postherpetic neuralgia during 12 months of treatment and for 6 months following treatment discontinuation. Within each center, participants will be randomized within four strata, defined by age at onset of HZO (less than 60 years or 60 years and greater) and by recent onset or chronic HZO (recent onset defined as HZO diagnosed within 6 months of enrollment/ randomization, or chronic defined as HZO diagnosed 6 months or more prior to enrollment/randomization).    A table of visits and required assessments is attached (attachment #2 - Schedule of Events).	\N	\N	672	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Please refer to section 10 of the attached protocol (attachment #1)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	Major factors in the anticipated success of ZEDS are the overall organization and operations support that was developed for clinical centers and the careful selection of clinical centers with an adequate population of eligible HZO patients, experienced clinical center research staff, and the expertise and infrastructure to support human subject research.  Data submitted by 60 clinical centers demonstrate an adequate eligible population.  There are 18 centers that reported treating over 100 HZO patients in 2012 or 2013 (mean 186/year), 17 centers with 50-99 HZO patients (mean 69/year), 22 centers with 20-49 HZO patients (mean 31/year), and 3 centers that on PCA treated less than 20 patients, but were included to enhance geographic diversity.  We estimate that enrollment of approximately 15% of the HZO patients the centers reported treating will enable fulfillment of enrollment goals. Potentially eligible patients will be identified and referred for participation in the study via a variety of methods.  It is expected that the most widely used strategy will be identification by the clinical center's PI, investigators, cornea fellows, ophthalmology residents, other ophthalmologists, and referring doctors. Many centers will screen medical records on a daily basis upon IRB approval.  Quarterly recruitment metrics will be submitted and compared to the milestone accrual plan registered with NEI at study initiation. If the study fails to achieve the targeted number of enrollments per quarterly metrics corrective action plans will be implemented in stages. Early in the trial timeline delays in site activation may need to be corrected to increase recruitment. The expected accrual period is approximately 36 month plus 12 months treatment and 6 months additional follow-up for last enrolled participant, and 6 month close-out and analysis period. The accrual period is expected to begin early summer 2017 with last subject completing follow-up in early summer 2021.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Eligible study participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to suppressive treatment with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily or placebo for one year.  Study participants will be followed every 3 months for a total of 18 months, 6 months following completion of the 12 month treatment period.  Study participants will be instructed to take 2 pills once daily in the morning.         Use of Divided Dose of Study Medication for Intolerance    If the study participant has mild to moderate side effects to the study medication, the medication will be temporarily discontinued, and when side effects resolve, the study participant may resume the study medication in divided doses, taking one pill twice daily, instead of two pills once daily, as it may be better tolerated.         Use of Reduced Dose of Study Medication for Intolerance    If the study participant has mild to moderate side effects to the study medicine when taken in divided doses, the medication will be temporarily discontinued, and when side effects resolve, the study participant may resume the study medication at a reduced dose of one capsule daily.         Discontinuation of Study Medication due to Intolerance    If intolerance to the study medication is moderate or worse after restarting the study medication in divided doses and reducing the dose, the study medication will be permanently discontinued. The study participant will be treated at the discretion of ophthalmologists involved in their care, and continue to be followed.  Open label use of other antivirals after study medication is discontinued will be collected and monitored.         Discontinuation of Study Medication    If the study participant develops a contraindication to valacyclovir (e.g., an exclusion criterion) during the course of the study (See 4.2.), the study medication will be permanently discontinued and the study participant will continue to be followed.	1	31	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	60	\N	1	\N	Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that long-term suppressive antiviral therapy can reduce complications of HZO by conducting a double-masked, placebo-controlled randomized trial of oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily. Specifically, we will evaluate whether or not long term suppressive antiviral therapy compared with placebo therapy will delay the time to the first occurrence of new or worsening dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis, and/or iritis compared to placebo, by 12 months (primary endpoint), and whether or not that treatment effect persists 6 months after cessation of treatment by 18 months (secondary endpoint) in immunocompetent patients with HZO who have a history of one of these disease manifestations within the year prior to enrollment. The primary endpoint is measured by the time to first occurrence of any one of these specified complications.         Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that suppressive treatment for 12 months with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily reduces the incidence, severity and duration of post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) compared to placebo at 12 and 18 months (secondary objectives) in patients with HZO. Given evidence that active VZV infection contributes to PHN, and the lack of effective and well tolerated treatment for PHN, it is important to prospectively collect data to study the efficacy of suppressive antiviral treatment for this extremely painful and debilitating condition that negatively impacts quality of life, especially in the elderly.  The results with regard to PHN may be generalizable to HZ in other anatomic locations; PHN lasts more than a year in nearly half of patients older than age 70, reduces quality of life in direct proportion to the severity and duration of pain, and more than quadruples the one year costs of the disease.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1050	\N	\N

The primary efficacy endpoint for this study would be improvement in clinical, spinal fluid markers, or targeted MRI enhancing abnormalities following treatment.  The anticipated assessment of treatment for each patient would be at three and six months.  Statistical support will be used to compare standard prednisone therapy, 1 mg/kg daily oral prednisone to infliximab therapy, in a regimen of infliximab 5 mg/kg at initiation, two weeks, four weeks, and then monthly for a total of six months.	\N	\N	266	\N	\N	145	\N	\N	The statistical plan, particularly the selection of the final study design, is expected to occur through consultation with the TIN. Given the study is unblinded (i.e., avoids the use of a double blind, double dummy design), mitigating bias particularly with discontinuation of therapy and possible crossover to infliximab is a design consideration. Preliminary sample size calculations are based on an non-inferiority test at the alpha=0.025 (to results in traditional 95% CIs for the estimated difference). Assuming the prednisone group will have 75% clinical success at 6 months and the infliximab arm will be at 85% due to continuation, there is 80% power to conclude non-inferiority with 58 and 29 participants in the infliximab and prednisone arms, respectively. This calculation is based on a limit of non-inferiority of -0.15, which is based on a 20% reduction of efficacy for the prednisone arm. Much larger sample sizes (impractically large) would be required to test for superiority unless the primary endpoint was modified to being a combination of efficacy and safety. We would be interested in discussions on alternative study designs and endpoints that will help minimize the sample size while providing a rigorous, interpretable study conclusion.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Allen J Aksamit MD has no conflicts to disclose.	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	Dr. Aksamit proposes a Phase 2 randomized trial to test whether infliximab infusions are a successful treatment of neurosarcoidosis compared to treatment with prednisone.

The initial dose will be 25 mg/day and will be titrated to 50 mg/day. The study population will be patients aged ≥50 years with stable HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40%), elevated natriuretic peptide levels, and an additional high-risk clinical feature.	\N	\N	465	\N	\N	56	\N	\N	The statistical comparison of the two randomized arms with respect to the primary endpoint will be a time-to-event analysis and, therefore, will be based on the time from randomization to CV mortality. The Cox proportional hazards regression model will be the primary tool to analyze and assess outcome differences between the two treatment arms. The Cox model analysis will include variables for treatment group, country/region, status at enrollment (inpatient or outpatient), age, enrollment LVEF, and sex. In addition to the statistical hypothesis testing, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates will be constructed based on the time from randomization to the first primary event occurrence.	\N	\N	\N	Sweden	4	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	4	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	The primary objective is to assess whether the initiation of spironolactone plus standard of care compared to standard of care alone reduces cardiovascular mortality in HFpEF.    HYPOTHESIS: Patients treated with spironolactone will reduce the primary endpoint, cardiovascular mortality, by 20% compared with usual care.    The specific aim of the SPIRIT-HFpEF study is to compare spironolactone versus usual care in patients with HFpEF in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial.     Key secondary aims and major secondary endpoints:   1.  Compare the effect of spironolactone to usual care on the major secondary endpoints of all-cause mortality and the composite of cardiovascular mortality or first rehospitalization for heart failure   2.  Demonstrate that a pragmatic randomized clinical trial can be performed in heart failure patients   3.  Build mutual capacity in Sweden and US for future pragmatic randomized clinical trials   4.  To develop, refine, and evaluate the infrastructure for the Trial Innovation Network and PCORnet to conduct multiple comparative-effectiveness trials in the future.	\N	\N	\N	In the intervention arm, patients will be treated with Spironolactone combined with usual care and patients in the control arm will get the usual care alone.  The inclusion period is planned to 3 years (2018-2021) and the follow up period is event driven and estimated to continue until end of 2023. The drug treatment continues after inclusion for each patient in the spironolactone arm until end of study (2023). This means that the treatment period varies among different patients, depending on time of enrollment.	1	171	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	120	\N	1	\N	The primary objective is to assess whether the initiation of spironolactone plus standard of care compared to standard of care alone reduces cardiovascular mortality in HFpEF.

He also suggested approving for an initial consultation and then utilizing local CTSA resources for as long as appropriate then switching to TIN resources when that becomes appropriate.  •\tDan Hanley and Ed Kuczynski both agreed that Danny Benjamin's suggestion would be acceptable to them.  •\tThe detail of when Central IRB services would be provided as the investigator requested would occur after the initial consultation is complete.  •\tMarianne Gildea asked if there is a way to edit a proposal after/during an initial consultation, and Michelle Jones responded that could be easily done.	\N	\N	56	0	\N	90

He noted that it would not be possible to completely separate ourselves from the international sites. He does not think standard agreements could handle this study, nor does he think the group should make decisions based on NHLBI enthusiasm.  •\tMarianne Gildea voted against the proposal.  •\tLupe Aquino voted against the proposal, and is in agreement with everyone else's comments.  •\tTiina Urv countered everyone's comments on NHLBI's enthusiasm by stating that because it is a large grant, the institute does need to show a lot of interest or they will likely not push it forward.  •\tMonica Shah agreed with Steve Mayo on avoiding voting on NIH enthusiasm. However, she also said that providing this service for 100 domestic sites seems feasible, but NYU has already received a service from the network. Therefore, if we did want to approve this, we would ask them to include a line item for CIRB in their grant application.	\N	\N	123	0	\N	0

He noted this study has been reviewed enthusiastically by NHLBI, and the only major negative is the absence of US sites; He noted the study will need site development work in the initial consultation  • Gordon Bernard noted this study could have a huge impact and is a practical intervention  • Paul Harris noted that while it would be interesting to partner with PCORNet, the Network might not get a big bang for your buck; He noted the turnaround for proposal itself is short, because they want to submit letter to NHBLI in October because they have a higher than 500k budget  • This study is over the PPG limit  • Steve Mayo noted it will be useful to gather protocol information not provided in original submission during the initial consultation  • Tiina Urv noted it is important to see the summary statements that were in the grant. In NIH, when you have internal grant, you have to make a case for why the sites cannot be in the US. It needs to look like a partnership, because NIH does not want the majority of the money going to Sweden. Currently, of the $7 million budget, $5 million will go to Sweden. She noted it will be important for the study to include a population group that is relevant to US patients  • Gordon Bernard noted that the scientific credibility of the study findings may be thrown into question because of the homogeneity in Sweden.  • Michelle Culp is concerned about the number of sites participating and the feasibility of recruiting from 40+ sites. She noted recruitment will be a huge effort and has concerns over the feasibility. She requested clarification on how PCORNet will be involved.   • Michelle Culp noted NHLBI is enthusiastic about the study, and considers it an opportunity to test the process of NHBLI working with Network and Study Investigator to develop an application  • Next Steps: Come up with a tight timeline on getting back to the investigator because of their upcoming deadline	2017-08-25 00:00:00	38	171	62.5	\N	90
